# Molibot ChangeLog

## Version 1.0

## 2026-06-23

### Per-agent dedicated models (text / vision / stt)
- Each agent can now override the text, vision, and speech-to-text model routes; everything else (TTS, compaction, subagent levels) keeps following the global routing at `/settings/ai/routing`. `AgentSettings.modelRouting` is optional and any empty key transparently follows global. The override is layered in one place — the runner wraps its `getSettings()` with `applyAgentModelRoutingOverride`, which resolves the bound agent from the workspace botId and replaces only the non-empty text/vision/stt keys — so all downstream model resolution (turn orchestration, compaction, media fallbacks) uses the agent's model without per-call-site changes, and the global settings object is never mutated. Configurable on the `/settings/agents` page (a "Dedicated Models" card reusing the `/api/settings/model-switch` route options, with a "Follow global" empty default), persisted end-to-end through the agent PUT API, sanitize, and a new `settings_agents.model_routing_json` column with an idempotent migration. The `/status` and `/models` chat commands are agent-aware too: `/status` shows the *effective* model with a `(agent: <id>)` / `(global)` source tag, and `/models` switching writes to the bound agent's override for text/vision/stt (affecting every bot linked to that agent) while tts/subagent and unbound bots still switch global — `/models <route> global` clears an override back to follow-global. Covered by new `applyAgentModelRoutingOverride` unit tests (4/4) and channelCommands `/models` agent-scope tests (25/25); store/settings suites stay green and the build passes.

### Dedicated compaction model
- Session context compaction (summarization) can now run on a model separate from the primary text model. A new `modelRouting.compactionModelKey` route lets you point summaries at a cheaper/faster model while the conversation keeps running on a stronger one; empty reuses the primary text model (unchanged default behavior). The compaction trigger threshold still keys off the *primary text model's* context window — only the summary call uses the dedicated model (`resolveCompactionSelection` in `routing/modelRouting.ts`, wired through `turnOrchestrator.compactSessionContext`). Configurable on the `/settings/ai/routing` page under the compaction settings, and persisted through schema/defaults/sanitize. Compaction/modelRouting suites stay green.

### Stream first-token timeout with model fallback
- Agent streaming runs no longer hang when an upstream model accepts the request but never starts responding. A new first-token timeout bounds the wait for the first *content* token: pi-ai's `start` (stream opened) and bare `*_start` (content block announced, no bytes yet) events keep the timer armed — the gap up to the first `*_delta` is exactly the time-to-first-token we guard — and only a real `*_delta`/`*_end`/`done`/`error` clears it, so a slow-but-alive model streams to completion untouched. On timeout the request is aborted and a retryable error is thrown, so the existing model-fallback loop switches to the next candidate, and if every candidate is exhausted the run returns an error instead of getting stuck. Default 60s (`MOLIBOT_MODEL_FIRST_TOKEN_TIMEOUT_MS`), configurable per deployment under `modelFallback.firstTokenTimeoutMs` and on the `/settings/ai/routing` page (`0` disables). Covered by `firstTokenStreamTimeout.test.ts` (5/5); runner/modelRouting suites stay green.

## 2026-06-21

### Bot Profile layering
- `BOT.md` now stacks on top of the linked agent/global `AGENTS.md` instead of replacing it, and both render in the upper operator-directives block before the default `<system-prompt>`. `AGENTS.md` renders first as the reusable base, then `BOT.md` adds bot-specific rules. Same-name identity files such as `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, and `SONG.md` keep the existing bot > agent > global override behavior. Covered by rendered prompt regression tests, including a Feishu bot linked to an agent.

### Feishu: emoji status reactions, no card title, quoted replies
- Removed the streaming/final card header (the Thinking/Processing/Completed title). Run status now appears as an emoji reaction on the user's own triggering message: `OnIt` while working, swapped to `DONE` on success, `CrossMark` on error, `No` on abort. Added `addFeishuReaction`/`removeFeishuReaction` helpers (`im.messageReaction.*`, fixed Feishu `emoji_type` keys) — best-effort and wrapped in try/catch so a missing reaction scope never breaks a run. The card `summary` is kept for notification previews.
- Replies now always quote the user's message (not only in thread mode): `replyOptionsForEvent` sets `replyToMessageId` whenever `platformMessageId` exists, with `reply_in_thread` only for topic-sourced messages — so back-to-back questions in plain group/p2p chats are easy to match to their answers. Requires the bot's message-reaction permission scope. Covered by cardkit (6/6) and streamingSession (4/4) suites.

### Approval Convergence — Phase 2 (b): single approvals table
- Merged the two approval persistence tables (`approval_requests` + `approval_grants`) into one `approvals` table with a `type` discriminator (`request` / `grant`), and switched both access classes — `SqliteApprovalStore` (broker) and `HostBashStore` (bash-domain workflow) — to read/write it. An idempotent migration copies any existing legacy rows into the unified table on startup; the legacy tables are left in place for reversibility and are no longer created or referenced by application code. Bash-domain rows remain tagged by `capability LIKE 'bash:%'`. Covered by the approval/hostBash/channelCommands/toolRuntime/turnOrchestrator suites (61/61).

### Approval Convergence — Phase 2 (a): removed the dead broker bridge
- Removed `resolvePendingBrokerRequests` and its call sites from `channelCommands.ts`. This cross-store bridge resolved a pending ApprovalBroker request whenever a Host Bash approval was answered, but with `bash` opting out of the broker and `bash` being the only high-risk built-in classification, no built-in tool ever creates a broker request — so the bridge never reconciled a real co-pending pair. A lock test (`toolClassification.test.ts`) pins this invariant and will fail if a future non-bash high-risk tool is added, signaling that its approval must be wired explicitly. The ApprovalBroker grant model itself (used by ToolRuntime and TurnOrchestrator) is unchanged.

### Image Generation Diagnostics
- `imageGenerate` now logs provider HTTP request URLs, redacted headers, request bodies, response status, and response body previews for both settings-page tests and Agent calls. Sensitive API keys are redacted, including Google `?key=` query params and authorization headers.

### OpenAI Images Provider
- Added an `openai` image generation engine using `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `https://api.openai.com`, and default model `gpt-image-2`. `/settings/image` now includes an OpenAI Images card and backfills old image settings with the new engine key so existing saved configs keep loading.
- Added an `openai-chat` image generation engine for OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` services. It posts a chat-completions payload and extracts image results from JSON fields, Markdown image links, plain image URLs, data URLs, or Base64 returned in the assistant message.
- `/settings/image` now gives every image provider an explicit enable/disable switch matching `/settings/video`; runtime routing ignores disabled engines even when an API key is present. Legacy image settings without per-engine `enabled` fields are backfilled from existing API keys.

## 2026-06-20

### Approval Convergence — Phase 2 first cut (ApprovalService façade, no behavior change)
- Added a unified `ApprovalService` interface (`approval/approvalService.ts`) with a broker-backed `BrokerApprovalService` adapter whose `waitForDecision` reuses the shared `pollUntilResolved` waiter. `ToolRuntime` now depends on `ApprovalService` instead of poking the `ApprovalBroker` directly (existing `approvalBroker` callers are unchanged — the option is wrapped in the adapter). Underlying stores are untouched; the Host Bash adapter and the removal of the cross-store bridge are later steps.

### Randomized Session Names
- `/new` Agent runtime sessions now use readable date-scoped IDs with a four-letter random suffix, such as `s-20260622-yush`, avoiding repeated numeric tails across different bots.
- Fresh scheduled task sessions use the same rule with a `task` prefix, for example `task-20260622-yush`, while retaining existing task-session pruning behavior.

### Web Tool Attachment Metadata
- Fixed Web Chat tool-generated attachments, such as screenshots sent via `attach`, being lost as structured session attachments. `/api/chat` and `/api/stream` now persist files uploaded through the runner `uploadFile` callback and attach their metadata to the final assistant message.
- Web attachment filenames now preserve the source extension when the display title has none, so a PNG screenshot titled without `.png` is still saved with `mediaType: image` and `mimeType: image/png`.

### Test Isolation — Runtime No Longer Boots Live Channels Under `node --test`
- Fixed agent tool/unit suites hanging after their assertions passed. Several tests transitively reach `getRuntime()` (for example the Host Bash path reads runtime settings through `buildHostEnv`), and `getRuntime()` is the full production bootstrap — it applied every channel plugin, started the task scheduler, and a 60s memory-sync interval. On a developer machine with real channel credentials this started a live Feishu websocket that retried forever (`[ws] Maximum number of redirects exceeded`), pinning the `node:test` process open so it never printed its summary or exited (affected `bash-output.test.ts`, `index.test.ts`, and any suite sharing the chain).
- Added `liveServicesDisabled()` (`app/env.ts`), gated on the `NODE_TEST_CONTEXT` runner flag (auto-detects `node --test`; never set in production) plus an explicit `MOLIBOT_DISABLE_LIVE_CHANNELS` opt-out. `getRuntime()` now skips channel application, the task scheduler, and the keep-alive memory-sync interval when live services are disabled, while still returning a fully usable runtime (settings/sessions/memory). `buildHostEnv` short-circuits to the `process.env` fallback under the same flag so host-bash unit tests don't boot the runtime singleton at all.
- Production behavior is unchanged (`NODE_TEST_CONTEXT` is never set outside the test runner). Regression covered by `app/runtime.test.ts`.

### MCP Settings Save Compatibility
- Fixed `/settings/mcp` dropping common HTTP MCP configs that provide a `url` without an explicit `type` / `transport`; these entries are now inferred as HTTP services instead of being filtered as invalid stdio services.
- Top-level MCP `headers` are now accepted and normalized into the persisted HTTP headers.
- Added `mcpInvoke`, a stable MCP dispatcher exposed only in explicit MCP scenarios. After `loadMcp` loads a server, agents can list loaded MCP tools and invoke them through `mcpInvoke` without relying on mid-run dynamic tool schema injection.
- Tool runtime wrapping now forwards abort signals and result details to wrapped tools, preserving MCP metadata such as server and remote tool names.

### Run Budget Degradation Fixes
- Fixed a cascade where hitting the tool-call budget overflowed into the tool-failure budget: budget-blocked tool calls were counted as tool failures, so a single over-budget turn (especially batched parallel tool calls) tripped the failure budget and hard-aborted the run with a generic error, bypassing the graceful no-tool continuation. Budget-blocked calls are now tracked by tool-call id and excluded from the failure count, and their repeated "budget exceeded" notices no longer spam the chat thread.
- When a run ends in an error after streaming a partial answer, the runner no longer replaces the whole message with "Sorry, something went wrong" (which discarded the visible partial). It now keeps the partial answer and appends a concise interruption note; the generic message is only used when nothing was shown to the user.

### Approval Convergence — Phase 1 (shared waiter + consolidated broker prompt, no behavior change)
- Extracted the duplicated approval polling loop shared by the two approval paths (the ApprovalBroker path in `ToolRuntime.pollApprovalRequest` and the Host Bash path in `waitForHostBashApprovalAndExecute`) into a single `pollUntilResolved<T>` primitive (`approval/approvalWaiter.ts`). Each path keeps its own store access and terminal handling in a `poll()` callback; timeouts, poll intervals, abort semantics, and inline execution are unchanged.
- Consolidated the two hand-built "broker approval card" construction sites inside `ToolRuntime` into one `buildBrokerApprovalRecord` helper (the pending card and the rejected/expired result previously duplicated the same envelope). Zero behavior change.
- First steps of the staged approval-convergence plan (see `docs/designs/agent-runtime/approval-convergence-plan-2026-06-20.md`).

### Subagent Runtime Hardening
- Subagents now run under an execution guard that reuses the parent runner's `RunBudget` and adds a wall-clock deadline. When a delegated task exceeds its tool/model budget or times out, the session is aborted and a structured stop reason (`budget_exceeded` / `timeout`) is returned instead of hanging or silently stopping. The deadline is enforced by an independent per-attempt timer (not only on session events), so an idle/stalled `session.prompt` is aborted too.
- Subagents now fall back across model candidates: `runSingleSubagent` resolves an ordered, de-duplicated candidate list (preferred route first, host model appended as a final fallback) and retries the next model on a plain model error — but not on success, abort, approval, or a budget/timeout stop. The single-route resolver is preserved for backward compatibility.
- Subagent results carry a budget snapshot, runtime stop kind, and duration, and these are threaded into the run summary (`RunSummary.subagent.tasks`) so each delegated task's budget, model, duration, and stop reason are visible in traces.

### Read Tool Schema Compatibility
- Made the built-in `read` tool's `label` input optional. File reads now validate with `path` alone, while runner hook logs still fall back to the tool name and `SKILL.md` reads continue to emit `skill.loaded` with `reason: read_skill_file`.

## 2026-06-19

### Settings Data Visibility Fix
- Fixed `/settings/agents` under production `node build` when started through the control/service path: built-in Subagent metadata now falls back to the source `subagent-agents` directory if the build chunk resource is absent, so `/api/settings/subagents` no longer 500s and the Agents page can render saved agents.
- Fixed `/settings/host-bash` for legacy persistent Host Bash grants whose `action_fingerprint` is `NULL`; whitelist rows now fall back to the capability tool id instead of throwing on `metadata.displayName`.

## 2026-06-18

### Stop Command Busy-State Release
- `/stop` now releases the channel busy marker immediately when it aborts an active runner or clears stale running state. It also marks the active run lock aborted and resets the runner instance, so the next user message starts normally instead of being queued behind a task that the user was already told had stopped.

## 2026-06-17

### Independent Control Daemon
- Added `bin/molibot-control.js`, an independent Telegram control daemon that can start/stop/restart the bare-metal service from a dedicated bot. It imports nothing from the main app, so it stays up when the main service is down and can bring a fully stopped service back online from chat.
- Control commands restricted to an admin allow-list (`MOLIBOT_CONTROL_ADMIN_IDS`); non-admin chats are silently ignored (their chat id is logged for setup). With an empty allow-list the daemon starts in discovery mode (authorizes nothing, logs chat ids) instead of refusing to start, avoiding a bootstrap deadlock.
- Two service sources: `/start` runs the release flow (`molibot-update.sh`: build latest git ref → deploy to `current` → start), `/start dev` and `/restart dev` target the local dev working tree. Dev commands run `npm run build` first (via a login shell so node/npm resolve from profile PATH) and abort on build failure; `/build` runs the build alone. `/stop`, `/status`, `/restart`, `/logs [n]` round out the set. Each command shells out to the relevant script and reports its output back to chat.
- Added `bin/molibot-control-service.sh`, a nohup-based supervisor (start/stop/status/restart, crash auto-restart) mirroring `molibot-service.sh`, to keep the control daemon alive.
- `molibot manage` now reads/writes `MOLIBOT_CONTROL_TG_TOKEN` / `MOLIBOT_CONTROL_ADMIN_IDS` in `deploy.env`, and `molibot-release.sh` bundles both new scripts into releases.
- Documented the design in `docs/designs/operations/control-daemon.md` with quick-start steps linked from the README.

### Telegram Command Menu Cleanup
- Telegram now registers a curated `setMyCommands` menu exposing only 8 everyday commands (`/new`, `/clear`, `/stop`, `/sessions`, `/status`, `/models`, `/skills`, `/help`), localized by runtime locale; registration failure warns without blocking startup.
- `/help` is now split into "Common commands" / "Advanced commands" groups, with advanced entries condensed into compact optional-argument rows.
- Non-destructive: every command handler still works (`TELEGRAM_SHARED_COMMANDS` unchanged); only the menu surface and help presentation changed.

### Telegram Rich Messages
- Upgraded `grammy` to `^1.44.0` (`@grammyjs/types@3.28.0`), which exposes Bot API 10.1 rich message methods and types.
- Telegram outbound text now prefers grammY `sendRichMessage` / rich `editMessageText` with `InputRichMessage.markdown`; rich failures fall back directly to grammY plain text sending instead of local Markdown-to-HTML conversion or local Markdown detection.
- Shared commands now emit one canonical Markdown shape across channels instead of Telegram-specific plain text: `/status` uses grouped Markdown lists, while `/help`, `/queue`, and `/skills` use standard Markdown table blocks that are handed directly to grammY/Telegram for rich rendering.
- Cleaned up the remaining multi-line command replies, including runlog, sandbox, thinking, model switching, login, sessions, queue, compact, and Host Bash approval messages, so command output uses Markdown headings, lists, command lists, and tables instead of plain single-newline paragraphs that Telegram rich Markdown can fold together.

## 2026-06-16

### Feishu Streaming Card Status Label
- The in-progress Feishu card header now shows a semantic status — "Thinking" while the model is reasoning and "Processing" otherwise — instead of the static product name "Molibot". The finalized card still switches to "Completed"/"Stopped"/"Error".

### Feishu Attachment File Type Fix
- Fixed Feishu attachments (e.g. generated `.mp4` videos) being sent as untyped generic files when a display `title` without an extension was provided. The upload filename now preserves the real file extension from the source path so videos send as native video messages, voice as audio, etc.
- Applied the fix to all three Feishu `uploadFile` paths via a shared `resolveFeishuUploadFilename` helper.

### Runlog Notice Controls
- Automatic archived-run notices are now disabled by default while run details continue to be stored.
- Added session, bot, and global controls via `/runlog on|off|reset`, `/runlog bot on|off|reset`, and `/runlog global on|off|reset`; `/runlog` still opens the latest record, while `/runlog status` is the status command.
- Added `/runlog list` for recent archived runs and expanded `/status` with runlog notice, sandbox, tool progress, and reasoning-display state.

### Feishu Topic Runlog Notice Threading
- Feishu streaming runs now send the archived runlog notice back into the originating topic/thread instead of the parent group chat.
- Added a Feishu runtime regression test covering topic-scoped archive notices.

### AGENTS Repeated-Fix Guardrails
- Analyzed recurring correction themes in `CHANGELOG.md` and extracted evergreen prevention rules into `AGENTS.md`, covering prompt/profile final-render checks, settings-page reactivity/design constraints, fine-grained settings persistence, isolated persistence tests, and cross-channel queue idempotency.
- Updated the documentation tracking files with a concise governance summary while keeping one-off bug history out of long-lived rules.

### Documentation Taxonomy
- Reorganized `docs/` by durable document purpose: requirements, designs, reviews, research, guides, and reference material now have separate top-level folders.
- Removed process-only execution plans, migration checklists, progress trackers, and completion logs from the main docs tree. Added `docs/README.md` as the docs taxonomy and filing-rules entrypoint, while leaving `docs/agent-dev-series/` and `docs/superpowers/` untouched as standalone collections.

## 2026-06-14

### Feishu Card Markdown Rendering
- Final Feishu CardKit replies now split markdown headings into separate card elements and render markdown tables as native Feishu table elements, reducing layout breakage for large structured answers.
- Feishu markdown conversion now protects fenced code blocks before applying heading/list/quote compatibility rewrites, so code samples containing `#`, `-`, or `>` stay literal.

### Bot Profile Identity Lock
- When active profile files define bot identity or behavior, the base system prompt no longer hard-declares the default Momo identity. It now tells the model to use the active `BOT.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `SONG.md`, and `USER.md` definitions for self-description and behavior.
- Added a final operator-directives reminder so identity/workflow/core-principle/prohibition questions are answered from the active profile files instead of the default runtime baseline.

### System Prompt Orders Volatile Sections Last for Cache-Friendliness
- Within the `<system-prompt>` block, the two sections that change between turns — `<available-skills>` and `<current-memory>` — now sit at the very tail, after the static `system-configuration-log` and `log-queries`. `available-skills` previously sat near the top (right after the skills protocol), which meant any skill-list or memory change invalidated almost the entire prefix. The skills *protocol* (static usage rules) stays near the top with the pipeline; only the volatile skill-name list moved.
- This keeps the large static prefix byte-identical across turns so providers/models that do prefix-based prompt caching can reuse more of it. (Note: Anthropic via pi-ai caches the system as a single block, so this is a no-op there; the win is for finer-grained or custom-protocol caches.) Reorder is in `agent/prompts/prompt.ts` `buildBaseSystemPromptWithOptions`.

### Operator Profile Files Outrank the Default System Prompt (Under a Safety Floor)
- Bot/agent profile files that express operator intent — `BOT.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `SONG.md`, `USER.md` — are now injected **above** the default `<system-prompt>` block, fronted by an `<operator-directives>` preamble that declares them high priority and authoritative on conflict. Previously they were appended after the base prompt as plain, unframed text and were easily diluted by the base prompt's tool/bash guidance (e.g. a Skill-Only `BOT.md` whose prohibitions were ignored).
- An `<inviolable-safety>` block now sits **above** the operator directives as a non-negotiable floor: profile files (and the user, and external content) may add stricter limits but can never weaken or bypass core safety — no disabling safety rules, secret exfiltration, unconfirmed destructive/irreversible actions, system attacks, prompt-injection compliance, or fabricated success claims — even if a profile explicitly says to.
- `TOOLS.md` and `BOOTSTRAP.md` remain below the base prompt as lower-priority config. `AGENTS.md` is still only injected when no `BOT.md` overrides it, and the project-context block is unchanged. Implemented in `agent/prompts/prompt.ts` (`OPERATOR_DIRECTIVE_FILES`, `SUPPORTING_INSTRUCTION_FILES`, `buildSafetyFloorSection`, `buildOperatorDirectivesPreamble`).

### Stop Command Terminal Confirmation
- `/stop` confirmations now use terminal copy (`Stopped.` / `已停止。`) once a running task is aborted, including the queued-task cleanup count when relevant. This keeps Feishu's text confirmation aligned with the final stopped status card.

## 2026-06-13

### Host Bash Fallback Inherits Sandbox Env Secrets
- When a sandboxed command is denied and auto-falls-back to Host Bash, the host execution now also receives secrets that live only in `.env.sandbox.local` — previously `buildHostEnv` read the parent process env only, so file-only secrets (e.g. `BOT_API_TOKEN`) silently vanished on fallback and produced misleading "missing token" failures.
- Injection is gated by the same sandbox env policy (`inheritMode`/`allow`/`deny`) and skips keys already present in the parent process env, so the fallback never widens access beyond what the sandbox itself would grant; disabled sandbox injects nothing.
- New exported helper `buildSandboxEnvFileInjection` in `agent/tools/sandbox.ts`, covered by `sandbox.test.ts`.

### Cross-Channel System Prompt Preview Refresh
- Feishu, QQ, and Weixin now refresh each bot workspace's generated `SYSTEM_PROMPT.preview.md` during no-op channel apply, matching Telegram when bot/profile Markdown changes without credential changes.
- Feishu and QQ apply/no-op logs now include `botId`, making preview refresh logs easier to correlate with channel instances.

### Treehole Poster Bot Profile Template
- Added `src/lib/server/agent/prompts/templates/treehole-poster/` with bot-level `BOT.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, and `SOUL.md` templates for a posting assistant that lightly cleans user thoughts and only publishes on explicit trigger.
- Split the template responsibilities so workflow rules, identity boundary, and voice guidelines do not repeat each other.

### Providers Page: Fix Dead Click Interactions (Reactivity)
- Fixed all clicks on the AI providers page (`/settings/ai/providers`) appearing dead: switching the Built-in/Custom tab did not change the sidebar list, and selecting a sidebar provider did not update the detail pane. Root cause was a Svelte 5 legacy-mode reactivity gap — the template rendered lists via bare no-argument helper calls (`{#each filteredCustomProviders()}`, `{#if getSelectedProviderInActiveTab()}`), which do not track the `activeProviderTab` / `selectedProviderId` / `providerSearch` reads happening *inside* those functions, so the blocks never recomputed.
- Introduced `$:`-derived `filteredProviders`, `selectedProviderDetail`, and `visibleModels` that reference their reactive dependencies explicitly, and switched the template to use them. The model registry also now reacts to the show-more/collapse toggle.

### Providers Page: Fix Selection Jump and Built-in Persistence
- Fixed the AI providers page (`/settings/ai/providers`) jumping to the first provider while editing a provider's **Provider ID**: the ID field is now synced with the selected provider key (and default-provider reference) instead of silently desyncing `selectedProviderId`, which previously caused the detail pane to fall back to the first listed provider and dropped the edited/new provider on save.
- `save()` now persists the currently selected provider even when it is a built-in one, so enabling a built-in provider and editing its model registry (capability tags, context window, per-model enabled toggle) actually takes effect instead of reverting on reload.

### AI Usage and Trace Pagination
- Implemented pagination for the "Request Event Details" table at the bottom of `/settings/ai/usage` and the "Recent Trace Facts" table at `/settings/ai/trace`.
- Added customizable page sizing (10, 20, 30, 50, 100 entries, defaulting to 20).
- Fully localized pagination information, selectors, and navigation buttons into both Chinese and English, reactively updating on language switch.
- Linked pagination state to filter controls so page numbers automatically reset to 1 when filters are changed.

### Trace Skill Usage Statistics
- `/settings/ai/trace` now surfaces skill calls alongside tool and model calls: added a "Skill 调用" metric card (total skill_usage facts, executed count, distinct skills) and a "技能使用排行" ranking table aggregated by skill name with triggered / loaded / executed / run / avg-duration columns.
- The trace stats API (`/api/settings/trace`) now aggregates `skill_usage` facts into per-skill summaries and totals (`skillUsages`, `executedSkills`, `distinctSkills`), reading level from `payload.level` and scope from `payload.scope`.

### CLI Readline Shutdown Guard
- Added a shared readline shutdown guard for the local CLI adapter so Ctrl+C or TTY `read EIO` closes quietly instead of throwing an unhandled Node `Interface` error.
- The CLI no longer calls `prompt()` after readline has already closed during an async message handler.

### Skill Usage Trace Phase 1
- Trace facts now record implicit skill loads when a successful `read` call opens a loaded skill's `SKILL.md`, using `reason: read_skill_file`.
- `skill_usage` facts now merge monotonically with `payload.level` and `payload.evidenceCsv`, so later weaker signals cannot downgrade a loaded skill fact.
- The durable Skill Usage Trace behavior is now documented through the product docs and Trace design notes instead of a separate progress checklist.

### Skill Usage Trace Phase 2
- Successful `skillSearch` results now emit `skill.selected` with `reason: search_match` for structurally valid matches from `details.matches`.
- Search-only skill candidates are recorded as informational triggered facts, while already loaded skill facts remain loaded and are not downgraded.
- Updated the skill usage tracking checklist to mark Phase 2 complete and keep executed attribution scoped to Phase 3.

### Skill Usage Trace Phase 3
- Skill frontmatter can now declare optional execution signals for `cli`, `mcp`, and `tools`, using either nested `signals:` metadata or flat `signals_cli` / `signals_mcp` / `signals_tools` fields.
- Runner now attributes successful post-load bash/tool/MCP calls to the most recently loaded matching skill and upgrades the skill fact to `payload.level: executed` with `cli_signal`, `tool_signal`, or `mcp_signal` evidence.
- Executed attribution is recorded as heuristic evidence only; triggered, loaded, and executed facts continue to merge monotonically through `payload.evidenceCsv`.

### Sidebar Emojis & Label Toggle
- Upgraded the 5 abstract primary sidebar symbols to intuitive high-fidelity Emojis (`🏠`, `🤖`, `💬`, `💾`, `⚙️`).
- Added a labels toggle button (`🏷️`) at the bottom of the sidebar to collapse/expand menu names alongside the icons.
- Persisted layout options in `localStorage` and added a CSS transition for smooth sidebar expansion, matching footer offsets.

### Reactive Multi-Language (i18n) Settings Support
- Fully migrated all 24 settings sub-pages to support complete reactive translation (English/Chinese) driven by the `$locale` store.
- Replaced MutationObserver-based translation (`localizeSettings`), resolving bugs where dynamic inputs, modals, and tables did not update on language switch.
- Standardized toggles to use the `IosSwitch` component and fixed footbars (`.settings-footbar`) across all migrated pages.

### Settings UI Redesign & Design System Alignment
- Refactored 11 settings sub-pages (`/settings/agents`, `/settings/memory`, `/settings/memory-rejections`, `/settings/skills`, `/settings/skill-drafts`, `/settings/run-history`, `/settings/tasks`, `/settings/host-bash`, `/settings/system`, `/settings/sandbox`, `/settings/plugins`) to align with Warm Shadcn theme and `/settings/web` style standard.
- Replaced custom layout styles and raw Tailwind CSS classes with semantic custom classes (`channel-page`, `channel-card`, etc.) to match `DESIGN.md`.
- Converted all configuration toggles to use the `IosSwitch` component instead of native input elements.
- Pinned configuration save/reset buttons to the sticky bottom footer bar (`.settings-footbar`) to simplify long form interactions.

### Scheduled Task Fresh Sessions & Auto Cleanup
- Scheduled events now support `sessionMode: "fresh" | "chat"`; periodic tasks default to fresh, so each run starts in a new `task-` session without accumulated chat history (big input-token saving for daily reports), while replies in the chat still land in that session for follow-up tweaks.
- Expired task sessions are pruned automatically on each fresh-session creation, controlled by `events.taskSessionRetentionDays` (default 7 days, 0 disables; env `MOLIBOT_EVENT_TASK_SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS`). Active and user-created sessions are never pruned.
- `createEvent` tool accepts `sessionMode`; all four channels (telegram/feishu/weixin/qq) route event runs through a shared session resolver.

## 2026-06-12

### Subagent Trigger Observability & Scenario Widening
- Run summaries now persist subagent telemetry (delegation notice sent, invoked, per-task agent/mode/stopReason/duration/error), making subagent usage auditable from `run-summaries.jsonl` instead of console logs only.
- Subagent trigger guidance widened from "codebase-heavy" to "file/shell-heavy" (log/data analysis, long documents, multi-file artifacts) in the system prompt and delegation runtime notice, with an explicit rule not to delegate steps needing parent-only tools (webSearch, imageGenerate, attach).

### Feishu Video Attachment Delivery
- Feishu outbound `.mp4` files now upload as `file_type: mp4` and send as native `media` messages instead of being transcoded into OPUS voice messages.
- Feishu inbound `media`/video resources now download through the media resource path and are saved as video attachments; `.mp4`, `.webm`, and `.mov` filenames no longer infer audio MIME types.

### Video Generation Response Logging
- `videoGenerate` now logs provider response status and response body for both successful and failed HTTP calls, so provider-side errors can be diagnosed from runtime logs.
- Video provider request headers are now redacted before logging, preventing Bearer/API keys from being printed in terminal logs.

### File Tool Hardening (read/write/edit/bash)
- edit: fixed silent corruption when newText contains `$&`/`$'`/`` $` `` (JS replacement patterns are now inserted literally); added `replaceAll` parameter; ambiguous matches now report the match count; identical oldText/newText is rejected early; CRLF files are matched LF-normalized and written back with their original line endings.
- read: rewritten to read via fs instead of spawning `wc`/`cat`/`tail`; fixed off-by-one total line count for files with trailing newlines; binary files are rejected with a clear error; images larger than 5MB are rejected instead of flooding the context.
- write: reported byte count now uses actual UTF-8 bytes instead of character count; removed dead path-normalization condition.
- bash policy: hard gate added — standalone shell file reads (`cat`/`head`/`tail`/`less`), shell file writes (`echo > f`, heredocs, `echo | tee`), and in-place editors (`sed -i`/`perl -i`/`awk -i inplace`) are denied with a redirect message to the read/write/edit tools; compound pipelines and concatenation remain allowed.
- bash tool description now instructs the model to prefer the dedicated read/write/edit tools over shell equivalents (`cat`, heredocs, `sed -i`, etc.), reserving bash for operations those tools cannot express.
- Removed dead duplicate `truncateTail` from tool helpers (the UTF-8-safe version in truncate.ts is the single implementation).

### Sandbox Writable Roots & Idempotent Approval Replies
- Sandbox now allows writes to the whole molibot data dir (`~/.molibot` by default) and the workspace dir, so scheduled tasks and services that write inside the data dir are no longer blocked; per-bot scratch remains the working directory.
- Temp directories are now allowed via their resolved real paths too (`/tmp` → `/private/tmp`, `os.tmpdir()` → `/private/var/folders/...`), fixing "Operation not permitted" for tools with hard-coded temp paths (e.g. longbridge's `/tmp/longbridge-logs`).
- Clicking an approval card again (or re-sending an approval reply) after the request is resolved now reports the actual outcome (approved/executing/executed/failed/rejected/expired) instead of "No matching pending Host Bash approval found."

### Host Bash Approval Interaction Fixes (Blocking Approval Gate)
- Approval cards/prompts now show at most the first 100 characters of the command instead of the full text (up to 4000 chars).
- Host approval is now a true blocking gate inside the agent run: the bash tool call waits on the approval store (up to 10 minutes), and once approved it executes the host command inline and returns the real output as the tool result — the run keeps streaming instead of ending with "waiting for approval" and resuming later. Rejection/expiry resolve the tool call immediately; only a wait timeout falls back to the old approve→execute→resume flow.
- Removed the double approval gate: bash `hostApproval` requests no longer also pass through the ApprovalBroker, so one approval click/reply is enough.
- Approval replies/clicks settle immediately: the card flips state right away while the waiting run (or, with no active run, a claimed background executor) runs the command; results and failures are reported to the chat.
- Added an atomic execution claim (`executing` status + `claimExecution`) so the in-run waiter and the channel approval handler can never both execute the same approved command.
- Fixed `isRunActive` to look up running runs by session (run ids are `chatId-sessionId-messageId`, so the old scope-id lookup never matched), plus a delayed fallback executor so approvals landing after the wait timeout are not dropped.
- Bridged Host Bash approvals to the agent ApprovalBroker for the remaining broker-gated tools; text approval replies (本会话允许 / 永久允许 / 拒绝 …) now work even when only a broker request is pending — fixing runs that ended in "User approval timeout" despite the user approving.

### Sandbox Host Bash Approval UX Overhaul
- Tightened sandbox-failure detection to OS-sandbox signatures only, eliminating spurious auto host-approval requests from ordinary command failures.
- Unified approval prompts to explicit scopes: once / session / persistent / reject, identical semantics across Feishu cards, Telegram keyboards, text replies, and `/hosttools` (new `approve-once` subcommand). Plain "approve" is now least-privilege (run once, no whitelist).
- Persistent approval of a compound command now whitelists every capability it contains in one click.
- Pending approvals expire after 60 minutes, and a new request for the same capability retires the older pending card; identical commands still dedupe to the existing request.
- Generic tool-approval path now shows the real command and uses collision-free request IDs.

### Profile Scope Consistency (bot > agent > global)
- Made `BOT.md` a true bot-level override of `AGENTS.md` in system prompt assembly: when a bot defines `BOT.md`, the agent/global `AGENTS.md` section is no longer injected alongside it, eliminating duplicated content after bootstrap.
- Restricted the `profileFiles` tool's agent-scope fallback to files the agent scope actually carries (`AGENTS/SOUL/IDENTITY/SONG`); `USER.md` and `TOOLS.md` now fall back straight to global, matching prompt assembly.
- Deduplicated profile file-name lists: the tool reuses `BOT_PROFILE_FILES`, prompt assembly reuses `GLOBAL_PROFILE_FILES`, and the editable-body normalizer is shared from `profiles.ts`.
- Hardened bot-root resolution in `profileFiles` to truncate paths to `/bots/<botId>`, and documented the per-file fallback chain (incl. global-only `BOOTSTRAP.md`) in the tool description.
### Agent Hook Framework Hardening & Pluggability
- Gate hooks now fail closed: a gate hook that throws or times out denies the guarded action (`HOOK_GATE_FAILURE`) instead of silently allowing it; hooks can opt into `failMode: "open"`.
- Observe event queues are now isolated per run, so a slow hook in one run no longer delays others; `flush()` accepts a `runId` and the runner drains its own queue with a longer timeout at run end. Emit payloads are snapshotted via `structuredClone`.
- Enabled the transform pipeline by default and wired it into the runner: transform hooks can rewrite enriched input text (`input.enrich.after`) and the system prompt (`prompt.build.after`).
- Fixed TraceRecorderHook state leaks with per-run nested maps plus a 1-hour TTL sweep for runs that never receive `run.finished`.
- Added a hook plugin registry (`registerHookPluginFactory` + `settings.plugins.hooks`) so external observe/transform/gate plugins can be enabled per settings entry; plugin hook ids are namespaced and unregistering flushes in-flight events before destroy.
- Added typed stage payloads (`StagePayloadMap`), a cached stage→hooks index, a shared `NOOP_HOOK_MANAGER`, and marked not-yet-emitted stages as reserved.

### Adapter-node SQLite Build Warning Cleanup
- Added a project-local adapter-node variant that marks `node:sqlite` as external during the adapter's final Rollup pass, removing the unresolved-import notices at the end of `npm run build`.
- Tightened the declared Node requirement to `>=22.5.0`, matching Molibot's use of built-in `node:sqlite`.

### Centralized DB Directory
- Added `${DATA_DIR}/db` as the default SQLite database directory and moved default settings, inbound queue, outbox, and Mory SQLite paths under it.
- Added startup migration for legacy root-level SQLite files, including WAL/SHM sidecar files, while preserving explicit operator-provided database paths.

### Feishu Multi-Bot Mention Ownership
- Tightened Feishu group mention gating so a bot instance only responds when the message mentions that bot's resolved identity. Mentions of other bots are ignored, and missing bot identity no longer falls back to responding to any group mention.
- Switched Feishu bot identity probing to `POST /open-apis/bot/v1/openclaw_bot/ping` first, matching the openclaw-lark SDK path. The old `bot/v3/info` endpoint remains a fallback because it can return `code: 0` with empty identity fields for these apps.
- Stopped Feishu queue workers from duplicating inbound tasks when a stale/busy run blocks processing, preventing runaway inbound queue growth and reducing SQLite lock pressure on startup.
- Restored shared inbound queue cleanup so completed, failed, cancelled, and startup-abandoned tasks are deleted from SQLite instead of retained as terminal rows.
- Kept private chat and bot-participated thread continuation behavior unchanged, with focused intake regression coverage for current-bot mentions, other-bot mentions, missing identity, and known-thread continuation.

## 2026-06-10

### Global Profile File Write Guard
- Removed `resolveGlobalProfilePath` auto-rerouting from `resolveToolPath` so profile file names (e.g., `SOUL.md`) are resolved relative to the caller's base directory rather than unconditionally routed to `dataRoot/`.
- Hardened `createPathGuard` to **block** direct read/write/edit tool access to global profile paths (`dataRoot/{AGENTS,SOUL,TOOLS,BOOTSTRAP,IDENTITY,USER,SONG}.md`), requiring the dedicated `profileFiles` tool for any profile file management. This prevents bot-scoped edits from accidentally landing on global profile files.

## 2026-06-08

### Feishu Bot Health Check & Thread Continuation
- Added `POST /api/settings/feishu/test` and a `/settings/feishu` connection test panel that validates current Bot credentials against Feishu Bot info without sending test messages or requiring a permission matrix.
- Added conservative Feishu group thread continuation: main group messages still require `@bot`, while threads the Bot has participated in can continue without mentions and keep their own session/queue/log scope.
- Routed Feishu thread replies through `im.message.reply` with `reply_in_thread` for text, cards, CardKit streaming, and outbound file fallback paths.

### Built-in TTS Generation
- Added a built-in deferred `ttsGenerate` tool with a dedicated TTS settings page (`/settings/tts`), macOS system voice support, Xiaomi MiMo TTS support, configurable voices/models, artifact saving, and automatic chat upload.

## 2026-06-07

### System Prompt Skill Routing Cleanup
- Merged the duplicated `Skill Routing (Mandatory)` prompt section into the existing message pipeline and skills protocol while preserving explicit skill invocation, authoritative skill file paths, output-medium handling, and fallback rules.
- Replaced the stale static `SYSTEM_PROMPT.preview.md` sample with a placeholder pointing auditors to the live generated prompt preview, preventing old manual event-JSON scheduling guidance from being reused.
- Added rendered prompt length regression coverage, corrected the refactor plan's verification commands to the actual Node test runner, and isolated ToolRuntime workspace whitelist tests from the real settings database.

### Runtime Log Hook Consolidation
- Replaced the built-in `DebugLogHook` with `RuntimeLogHook`, a HookManager observer dedicated to centralized runtime log output.
- Moved duplicate runner lifecycle/tool logs (`run_start`, `run_end`, `tool_start`, `tool_end`, `tool_call_blocked`) behind hook events while preserving run detail archives and UI runner events.
- Enriched tool hook payloads with display labels so terminal logs keep the same readable tool names after hook-based logging.

### Expanded Trace Fact Coverage
- Extended trace facts beyond `tool_call` and `model_call` to include `run`, `skill_usage`, `subagent_task`, `runtime_notice`, `approval`, and `input_enrichment`.
- Added runner hook emissions for input enrichment, subagent task progress, Host Bash approval requests, and key runtime notices so those facts have real runtime sources.
- Updated `/settings/ai/trace` filtering and summaries so new fact types appear in recent facts without being counted as model requests.

### Trace Facts Model Usage Alignment
- Added a runner-level fallback that emits `model.call.after` with assistant `usage` at message completion, so `/settings/ai/trace` model facts now retain input/output/cache/total token details even when provider response hooks did not carry usage.
- Split trace model attempt IDs per real model API request inside one Agent prompt, so tool-result continuation calls are stored as separate `model_call` facts instead of overwriting the first request.
- Kept `/settings/ai/usage` and `/settings/ai/trace` as separate data stores while aligning them through run/session/model-attempt trace facts.
- Added total-token fallback calculation in TraceRecorder when providers omit explicit totals.

## 2026-06-06

### Channel Settings Pages Restyling & Fixed Footer
- **Semantic CSS Classes**: Replaced all inline Tailwind utility classes in channel settings pages (web, telegram, weixin, feishu, qq) with `.channel-*` semantic CSS classes defined in `settings-custom.css`, following DESIGN.md CSS class naming conventions.
- **Fixed Footer Bar**: Added `.settings-footbar` fixed footer to all channel pages with save/reset buttons pinned to viewport bottom, matching the MCP page pattern.
- **Switch Conversion**: Converted Checkbox toggles to Switch components for enable and streaming output controls across all channel pages.
- **MCP Footer Cleanup**: Removed remaining Tailwind utility classes from MCP settings page footer, adding `.settings-footbar-saving`, `.settings-footbar-pulse`, and `.settings-footbar-actions` semantic classes.

### SQLite Settings Migration & Fine-grained APIs
- **Database Migration**: Moved `webSearch` (search configurations), `imageGenerate` (image settings), `videoGenerate` (video settings), and `toolSandbox` (sandbox directories allowlist/denylist) from `settings.json` to the key-value SQLite table `settings_dynamic`.
- **Merged Key-Value Store**: Abandoned the creation of 7 separate tables in favor of serializing settings as JSON strings stored under keys: `settings_web_search`, `settings_image_generate`, `settings_video_generate`, and `settings_sandbox`.
- **One-off Configuration & Table Migration**: Implemented automatic migration in `SettingsStore` during startup. Legacy configs in `settings.json` as well as any existing legacy SQLite tables (e.g., `settings_web_search`, `settings_sandbox`, etc.) are read, converted to key-value rows in `settings_dynamic`, and cleaned up.
- **Unified Dynamic API Route**: Added a unified, parameter-driven dynamic settings endpoint at `/api/settings/dynamic/[key]` supporting `GET` (read), `PUT`/`POST`/`PATCH` (write/update). Frontend settings pages (search, image, video, sandbox) are refactored to fetch and save their individual configurations via this targeted route, completely bypassing the obsolete monolithic query and individual PUT routers.

### AI Providers Page Switches & Model Enable Save Fix
- **Independent custom-providers Endpoint**: Extended `/api/settings/custom-providers` with `GET` and `PUT` methods. Refactored the AI Providers settings page (`/settings/ai/providers`) to fetch and save its configurations using this dedicated endpoint, completely removing monolithic settings API queries and updates from the page.
- **Shadcn iOS Switch Toggles**: Replaced the custom HTML checkbox elements for provider enabled status and individual model enabled status on the AI Providers page (`/settings/ai/providers`) with unified iOS-style `Switch` components from the shadcn-svelte UI library.
- **Model Enable Save Bug Fix**: Resolved an issue where toggling individual models off in the list would not persist. Extended `ProviderModelConfig` in `schema.ts`, added proper mappings inside the page Svelte `save()` function, and updated sanitization and store logic in the server settings modules (`sanitize.ts`, `store.ts`) to carry and persist the `enabled` field. Also corrected `ensureProviderDefaults` to prevent dropping the `enabled` field during mapping normalization, and updated `addModel`, `confirmAddModel`, and `addDiscoveredModel` to default-initialize `enabled: true`.
- **Model Selection & Routing Filter**: Implemented `enabled !== false` filters in `modelRouting.ts` and `modelSwitch.ts` to ensure that custom models toggled off are excluded from routing alternatives, default selections, and settings routing dropdown options.
- **Svelte 5 a11y & Compiler Warnings Fixed**: Resolved Svelte compiler accessibility (a11y) warnings on `providers/+page.svelte`, `image/+page.svelte`, and `video/+page.svelte` by making modal backdrops self-targeted dialogs, removing click handlers from static modal cards, labeling icon-only close buttons, and adding a valid captions track to the video preview.

### Agent HookManager Runtime Extension & Trace System
- **Pluggable HookManager**: Implemented a multiplexed `HookManager` layer on top of `pi-agent-core` callbacks to dispatch hook events asynchronously (non-blocking) to observe, gate, and transform hooks.
- **Built-in Telemetry Plugins**: Added `DebugLogHook` for console diagnostic logging and `TraceRecorderHook` backing event traces into a local SQLite store (`agent_trace_events` table with sequential `seq` auto-increment ordering) isolating states by `runId`.
- **Unified Trace Facts**: Added `agent_trace_facts` as a single analysis table for both `tool_call` and `model_call` facts, with queryable columns for session/run counts, tool names, statuses, model identity, durations, and token usage.
- **Trace Analytics Settings Page**: Added `/settings/ai/trace` and `/api/settings/trace` to inspect trace facts with time-window, Bot, channel, chat ID, session ID, run ID, fact type, and source-limit filters, plus tool/model token/Bot/channel-chat/session/run summaries and recent fact rows.
- **Preflight Gate Interceptions**: Supported gate net interceptions in `MomRunner` before tool preflight and execution budget checks, emitting `tool.call.blocked` with `blockedBy: "hook_gate"`.
- **Clean Registry Integration**: Injected `hookManager` dependency throughout all channels (Telegram, Feishu, QQ, WeChat, Web) and wired up runner pools/runtimes without introducing API regressions.
- **Lifecycle Hardening**: Ensured `run.finished` is emitted once for early Runner exits, passed real runtime settings into plugin initialization, and kept the observe queue alive after critical observer failures.

### Settings Pages Hero Header Compact Unification
- **Header Size Reduction**: Reduced title size from `2rem`/`1.875rem` to `1.375rem`, description text to `0.8125rem` (13px), and inner gap from `0.75rem` to `0.375rem` across all settings pages (including the 8 core AI pages and 16 Tailwind inline pages) to yield a much cleaner and space-efficient viewport layout.
- **Top Spacing Fix**: Adjusted Svelte container wrappers inside `.settings-viewport` to override default padding-top values (from `5rem` or `2.5rem` down to a unified `0.5rem`), eliminating redundant top empty areas.

### Settings Pages Footer Full-Width Fix & Style Extraction
- **Full-Width Footer**: Converted footer divs (`<div class="settings-footbar">`) to HTML5 semantic footers (`<footer class="settings-footbar">`) on all AI-related settings pages (Routing, Providers, Errors, MCP, Search, Video), resolving the narrow width issue caused by `.settings-viewport > div` overrides.
- **CSS Style Extraction**: Removed all Svelte `<style>` scoped blocks from settings page `.svelte` files and consolidated them into the global stylesheet `src/styles/settings-custom.css`, which is imported globally in `src/app.css` to prevent inline head generation.
- **Inline Style Cleanup**: Replaced inline styles on the Search settings page test alert with a `.search-test-result[data-tone="success"]` utility class.

### AI Settings Pages Styling Unification & Center Alignment
- **Centered Layout**: Refactored the page content containers for all AI-related settings pages (`routing`, `providers`, `usage`, `errors`, `mcp`, `search`, `image`, `video`) to align centered (`margin: 0 auto;`) in the viewport.
- **Full-Width Fixed Footer**: Relocated the sticky bottom save/reset fixed footer (`.settings-footbar`) outside the centered page container wrappers, allowing it to stretch across the full width of the viewport.
- **Hero Headers Unification**: Removed `SettingsSection` layout wrappers from the Providers (`/settings/ai/providers`) and Image (`/settings/image`) settings pages, replacing them with custom serif hero headers (`.providers-hero`, `.image-hero`) matching the AI Routing page's look and feel.
- **Video Settings Page Refactor**: Restructured `/settings/video` to wrap parameters in a `<form id="video-form" ...>` and relocated the save button from the card bottom to the sticky bottom fixed footer (`.settings-footbar`) aligned with other settings pages.

### Telegram Video Attachment Filename Preservation
- Preserved source file extensions for Telegram media uploads when `attach` supplies a title without an extension, so generated MP4 videos upload as names like `title.mp4` instead of extensionless titles.
- Added `supports_streaming: true` to native Telegram `sendVideo` uploads.
- Added regression coverage for extension preservation in `runtime.test.ts`.

### Settings Pages Styling Refactor (errors/mcp/search)
- Refactored `/settings/ai/errors`, `/settings/mcp`, and `/settings/search` to match the custom Warm Shadcn design system, removing the legacy `.wb-` styling classes in favor of serif headings, `var(--card)` backgrounds, and `var(--border)` borders.
- Replaced the `SettingsSection` layout wrappers on these pages with custom scoped Hero header structures.
- Implemented sticky bottom save/reset bars (`.settings-footbar`) for MCP and Search routes linked to `<form>` submit events, and moved the refresh action in the Errors page to the bottom footer.
- Switched manual toggle switches in the MCP servers list and search engines list to the native `<Switch>` component with Svelte 5 bindability.

### Image Generation SQLite Logging, Settings History & Sticky Footbar
- Added a new `image_tasks` SQLite table storing image generation records (Task ID, engine, session ID, status, prompt, local path, remote URL, request parameters, error message, and timestamps).
- Modified the `imageGenerate` tool to generate a unique UUID and record task creation as `processing` before executing, updating the record to `completed` or `failed` at completion.
- Added `/api/settings/image-generate/tasks` API endpoint to retrieve recent tasks and delete records by Task ID.
- Added `/api/settings/image-generate/image` serving endpoint to stream local image files or redirect playback/download to the provider's remote `imageUrl` if local files are missing.
- Added a "Recent Generations" table to `/settings/image` showing creation time, Task ID, engine, prompt, and status.
- Added "View Result" (pop-up displaying metadata and image with download functionality), "View Params" (displaying request parameters), and "Delete" actions to the task list.
- Refactored the image settings submission form to use a sticky bottom bar (`.settings-footbar`) to house the save button and status message in accordance with `DESIGN.md` design principles.
- Updated unit tests in `imageGenerateTool.test.ts` to mock database initialization, verify tool execution writes task records to SQLite, and assert properties of the task record.

### Remote Video URL Storage, Redirect Streaming & Request Parameters Logging
- Removed automatic client-side video file downloading from both the SvelteKit background task poller and the `videoGenerate` tool query execution to prevent connection reset failures (like `ECONNRESET` on Google Cloud Storage) from marking successful tasks as failed.
- Dynamically migrated the SQLite settings database to add `video_url` and `request_params` columns to the `video_tasks` table.
- Made `videoGenerate(taskId, engine)` treat SQLite as the first status source: completed records return the cached remote URL immediately, fresh processing records return cached progress for 30 seconds, and stale processing records perform one provider status query before writing the result back to the database.
- Logged the exact request parameters (prompt, model, images) sent by the Agent/tester upon task creation.
- Added a `302 Found` HTTP redirect in the SvelteKit video streaming endpoint `/api/settings/video-generate/video` to transparently route playback/download requests to the remote `videoUrl` if the local file is missing.
- Updated `/settings/video` page UI tasks table list and details modal to render inline previews, handle direct downloads using the redirect endpoint and `videoUrl`, provide a "View Params" (查看参数) action button directly in the table actions list, and display request parameters inside a scrollable copyable JSON block.
- Updated unit tests in `videoGenerateTool.test.ts` to assert that completion updates the database with `videoUrl`, returns `Remote URL` instead of `unknown` local paths, skips remote video downloads, and normalizes string/JSON-string `images` inputs.


### Image Path Visibility & Robust Parameter Normalization
- Added `Remote URL: https://...` to the successful return text and details of `imageGenerate` whenever the provider returns a public image URL, while keeping local saved paths for archive/debug use.
- Made automatic chat upload failures non-fatal for `imageGenerate`: generated images now still return their Remote URL/local path plus an upload error note when Telegram or another channel fails to send the file.
- Upgraded `videoGenerateSchema` to support both `Type.Array(Type.String())` and `Type.String()` for the `images` parameter.
- Normalizes `params.images` at runtime: JSON-stringified arrays (e.g. `'["/path/to/img"]'`) are parsed, and single strings are wrapped in arrays, preventing iteration errors on characters of a string.
- Changed `videoGenerate` image references to require public HTTP(S) URLs and reject local paths or Base64/data URLs before submitting to providers. This matches Agnes Video's public-image-URL requirement and lets the Agent use the `Remote URL` from `imageGenerate` for image-to-video.
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `imageGenerateTool.test.ts` and `videoGenerateTool.test.ts` to assert Remote URL output, stringified URL arrays, single URL strings, and pre-submit rejection of local/data URL image references.

### Video Generate Public URL Validation & Poller Fault Tolerance
- Fixed a bug where remote video generation services (Agnes AI and Volcengine/Doubao) failed to generate videos from local reference images or Base64/data URLs because video providers require publicly reachable image URLs.
- `videoGenerate` now rejects local paths and Base64/data URLs before submitting the task payload, and tells the Agent to use the `Remote URL` returned by `imageGenerate`.
- Added strict public URL checks for reference images, preventing invalid requests from being sent to the cloud.
- Formatted structured error objects returned by Agnes AI (containing both code and message) into serialized strings, avoiding SQLite parameter binding crashes when updating failed task records.
- Implemented poller fault tolerance in the background tasks SvelteKit poller, marking the task as `failed` in the SQLite database after 3 consecutive failures (or when hitting a terminal HTTP 4xx response) to prevent infinite loops of failing requests.
- Added test coverage in `videoGenerateTool.test.ts` to verify remote image URL passthrough plus local path and Base64/data URL rejection before provider submission.

### Telegram Streaming Long-Message Chunk Reuse
- Fixed Telegram streaming answers repeatedly creating a new second message after the answer crossed the text limit.
- The answer lane now retains all chunk message IDs, edits existing chunks on later stream refreshes, creates only newly required chunks, and removes obsolete trailing chunks when the answer becomes shorter.
- Added regression coverage for consecutive chunk refreshes and chunk-count reduction.

### Video Query Bypass Optimization
- Optimized the `videoGenerate` tool execution path when querying status: the tool now performs a pre-check query on the local SQLite task database.
- If the task record is already in a finalized state (`completed` or `failed`), the tool immediately returns the cached state and locally saved video file path (performing a channel file upload if `uploadFile` is available) instead of making a redundant query to the third-party provider API. This prevents errors like `fetch failed` from interrupting the session when completed tasks expire on third-party servers.
- Added comprehensive unit test coverage in `videoGenerateTool.test.ts` to assert that completed tasks return the cached status immediately without invoking the remote HTTP client.

### Telegram Native Video Message Support & MIME Optimization
- Fixed a bug where MP4 videos containing audio tracks were mistakenly classified as `audio/mp4` during binary header sniffing (which looks for the `ftyp` signature). This caused videos to be sent via the `sendAudio` pathway, rendering them as audio-only messages in Telegram.
- Introduced `detectVideoMime` in `TelegramManager` to extract video MIME types for `.mp4`, `.webm`, and `.mov` extensions, and updated `detectAudioMime` to exclude files ending in these extensions.
- Configured `uploadFile` to send identified video MIME files using Telegram's native `bot.api.sendVideo` API, ensuring inline video playback and native downloads in the chat, falling back to `sendDocument` upon failure.
- Added test coverage in `src/lib/server/channels/telegram/runtime.test.ts` to verify accurate detection of both audio and video files.

### Video Settings Task ID Display
- Added a new "Task ID" column to the "Recent Generation Tasks" table on the `/settings/video` page.
- Rendered task IDs using a compact, copy-friendly `font-mono` format and the `select-all` helper class, so operators can quickly select and copy the identifier to query task progress manually inside chat threads.

### Video Results Inspection & Test Isolation
- Isolated the unit test SQLite database for `videoGenerateTool.test.ts` by adding a `taskStore` option to `createVideoGenerateTool`. This directs mock task creations to a temporary SQLite file inside the test's scratch directory, preventing the real user `settings.sqlite` database from being polluted with test entries during dev/build cycles.
- Created `/api/settings/video-generate/video` endpoint to stream saved local video files safely by task ID.
- Added a "View Result" button for completed and failed tasks on the `/settings/video` page, triggering a dialog summarizing task ID, prompt, engine, local file path, or error logs, and featuring a built-in HTML5 video player to play generated videos inline.

### Compact Tool Progress Copy
- Shortened `toolProgress = "new"` running-state text from `⏳ 正在运行: <tool>...` to `⏳ <tool>...`, leaving more horizontal space for the actual tool name.
- Added a focused `displayFormatter.test.ts` regression test to lock the compact output format.

### Image Generation Settings Optimization
- Added support for custom Model ID configurations per provider (Agnes, Google Imagen, Volcengine, ModelScope) in the `/settings/image` UI and the backend `imageGenerate` tool context.
- Removed individual engine `enabled` flags from the schema and UI. Engines are now dynamically resolved as enabled simply by detecting a configured, non-empty API key, aligning backend routing with simplified user experience.
- Implemented full `zh-CN` / `en-US` translation support, responsiveness, and dark-mode adaptation for the entire `/settings/image` interface.
- Updated unit tests in `imageGenerateTool.test.ts` to assert that settings routing correctly ignores explicit engine-level enablement checks and routes traffic based purely on API key configuration presence.

## 2026-06-05

### Settings Overview Redesign
- Redesigned the `/settings` overview page from a flat 14-card grid to a grouped 4-card dashboard (AI Intelligence, Messaging, Knowledge, System) matching the Warm Shadcn design sample.
- Added Lucide icons (Cpu, MessageSquare, BookOpen, Settings) and Shadcn Badge section counts to each feature card.
- Used serif typography for the page title and feature card headings per DESIGN.md editorial style.
- Added compact subsection links inside each card with hover-reveal arrow navigation.
- Full zh-CN/en-US localization and dark mode support for the new layout.

### Settings Layout Header Redesign
- Replaced the sidebar header from "Configuration Workspace + Settings" large text to a centered brand dot + serif "Settings" title + compact "Back to Chat" pill button, matching the Warm Shadcn design sample's primary sidebar style.
- Changed the top bar from "workspace title + page name" to a breadcrumb pattern "Settings › [Current Page]" with theme/language selectors and "Open Chat" on the right.
- Added semantic CSS classes (`.settings-sidebar-header`, `.settings-topbar-breadcrumb`, etc.) following DESIGN.md naming conventions.
- Preserved mobile collapsible navigation dropdown with updated styling.
- Removed unused `workspaceTitle` i18n key.

### Settings Navigation Menu Restyle
- Changed nav link style from `rounded-xl border text-xs` card-like to `rounded-sm text-sm` borderless list matching the design sample's `nav-item` pattern.
- Updated active state to use `accent-soft` background + `accent` text color + inset border shadow, matching the design sample's active icon style.
- Replaced group title `uppercase tracking` with normal-case 12px labels and a ▾ chevron that rotates on collapse.
- Moved all nav styles to semantic CSS classes (`.settings-nav-link`, `.settings-nav-group-title`, etc.) in the `<style>` block, removing Tailwind inline strings from `navLinkClass()`.

### Built-In Video Generation Tool
- Introduced native Agent-layer tool `videoGenerate` supporting Agnes Video and Volcengine (Doubao Seedance) engines.
- Implemented a dedicated configuration UI at `/settings/video` supporting custom model configurations per provider, enable toggles, API keys, custom base URLs, and en-US/zh-CN localization.
- Added live testing console to `/settings/video` coupled with the `/api/settings/video-generate/test` backend endpoint to validate credentials and render generated videos in the web interface.
- Integrated the video settings entry under the "AI Engine" group of the settings workspace layout.
- Added async polling handlers for task-based video generation with aspect-ratio mappings, duration limits, download automation, sandbox path-guard controls, and automatic channel media upload routing.
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `videoGenerateTool.test.ts` covering task creation, status polling, file downloads, and parameter verification.
- Implemented non-blocking asynchronous task execution: immediately registers tasks in SQLite database upon submission, returns the taskId to the Agent, and releases the turn without holding the connection.
- Added background polling API that performs periodic queries, downloads finished videos, updates task records, and outputs detailed HTTP request and response logs (including URL, request body, and response body) to the server console.
- Configured frontend settings UI to trigger background polling at a 30-second interval instead of 4 seconds to optimize traffic while keeping status indicators updated.

### Feishu Approval Card Terminal State
- Changed completed Feishu approvals to edit the original button card into a terminal result card, avoiding Feishu withdrawal time limits for approvals handled minutes or hours later; text is sent only when editing fails.
- Deduplicated concurrent HTTP/WebSocket callbacks and later repeated clicks by request ID so one approval action executes once and all callbacks reuse the same button-free result card.
- Replaced the pending-confirmation title with a clear processed-approval title on terminal cards.
- Returned a button-free processing card within Feishu's three-second long-connection callback window, then edited the original card to the final result after background execution.
- Extended shared approval auto-resume waiting from about five seconds to one hour so approvals wait for an active session to finish instead of immediately asking for another user message.
- Stopped sending approved Bash stdout/stderr and resume progress as standalone chat messages; command results now return through the Agent tool context and appear only in the Agent's final response.

### Reliable Bash Stop Finalization
- Fixed `/stop` so an aborted bash/Agent prompt terminates the current run instead of being retried as an empty model response or continued through model fallback.
- Skipped blocked UI queue flushing after abort and cleared pending progress updates so sessions return to idle after the command process is killed.
- Preserved partial assistant text produced before cancellation without converting the cancelled run into a generic error.

### Concise Approval Confirmation Copy
- Reduced Host Bash approval prompts to the action, complete command, and three clear decisions: approve, allow for this session, or reject.
- Removed internal request IDs, classifier details, permission dumps, and implementation explanations from chat approval prompts while retaining them in the approval records.
- Reused the same concise prompt across interactive approval cards and non-interactive text channels.

### Global Command Response i18n
- Persisted the Settings language selection as a global runtime locale.
- Localized shared channel commands and Web Chat command responses for `zh-CN` and `en-US`.
- Added locale-aware help, status, model, skill, session, queue, runtime-control, sandbox, and display-control responses.
- Removed OAuth login/logout entries from shared-channel and Web Chat help catalogs without removing the commands.

## 2026-06-04

### Built-In Image Generation Tool
- Added native `imageGenerate` tool in `imageGenerateTool.ts` and registered it as a deferred agent tool.
- Supported multi-engine API integrations: Agnes-Image-2.0-Flash, Google Imagen, Volcengine (Seedream), and ModelScope.
- Standardized settings configurations mapping `AGNES_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `VOLCENGINE_API_KEY`, and `MODELSCOPE_API_KEY` environment variables.
- Configured automated download, sandbox path validation, and channel upload integrations, making generated images instantly viewable in chat interfaces.
- Added `/settings/image` dedicated settings UI and a live test generation panel mapping to `/api/settings/image-generate/test` backend endpoint.
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `imageGenerateTool.test.ts` covering provider execution, base64 decoding, task polling, and file saving.
- Fixed legacy settings startup compatibility, honored the configured default image engine, and routed settings-page test outputs to Molibot data storage instead of the project directory.
- Fixed Agent routing so image generation/editing requests in any language are recognized by intent and load `imageGenerate` through `toolSearch select:imageGenerate` before skill search, bash scripts, or ad-hoc skill creation.
- Fixed image settings normalization so a configured default image engine with an API key is treated as enabled even when older settings carried `enabled: false`; clarified the per-engine enabled switch in `/settings/image`.


### Host Bash URL and Helper Classification Fix
- Fixed Host Bash classification so quoted URL query strings such as `agent-browser open "https://example.com/search?q=..."` no longer trigger the glob-expansion one-time approval path.
- Treated static `cd <path>` wrappers and simple `echo DONE` markers as safe helpers around approved capabilities, while dynamic paths such as `cd "$HOME"` remain one-time scripts.
- Added focused regression tests for quoted URL queries, unquoted glob tokens, safe `cd` / `echo` wrappers, and dynamic `cd` degradation.

### Telegram Overlong Edit Chunking
- Unified Telegram text chunking and formatting fallback logic in the shared formatting layer instead of keeping separate send/edit implementations.
- When `editMessageText` now fails with `MESSAGE_TOO_LONG`, Molibot edits the first chunk in place and sends the remaining chunks as follow-up messages instead of terminating the run.
- Thread-aware Telegram send options are forwarded into the follow-up path so forum-topic replies stay in the same thread.

### System Prompt Boundary Refactor (P0 & Sandbox Cleanup)
- Compressed event management, scheduler, and tool-search details in the system prompt (`prompt.ts`), routing cron and confirm rules to the deferred tool schemas.
- Merged the previously scattered global behavioral guardrails into one `Core Directives` section, including processed-input handling for pre-transcribed voice and pre-analyzed images.
- Refactored sandbox descriptions from low-level OS implementation details (like `sandbox-exec` and `bubblewrap` paths) to concise model decision boundaries.
- Aligned `bash` tool description and parameter schema metadata to reflect runtime-managed sandbox boundaries and hostApproval reason instructions.
- Added regression tests in `prompt.test.ts` and `bash-output.test.ts` to enforce the refactored system prompt rules and prevent sandbox implementation detail leaks.

## 2026-06-03

### Deferred Web Search Deduplication
- Kept `webSearch` in the deferred registry but stopped exposing its lightweight top-level stub, so loading it through `toolSearch` no longer produces duplicate `webSearch` tool names in provider requests.
- Added a focused regression assertion for the deferred-only `webSearch` exposure path.

### Cloudflare HTML File-Path Uploads
- Changed the built-in `publishHtml` plugin tool to accept a local file path instead of raw HTML content.
- Runtime now reads and validates the HTML file internally before uploading to Cloudflare R2, reducing token/context pressure for large pages.
- Kept normal workspace path-guard enforcement and added focused regression coverage for file-based uploads.

### Deferred Tool Registry Alignment
- Added `webSearch` to the runtime deferred tool registry so `deferredEntries` now matches the prompt's `<available-deferred-tools>` list.
- Added a prompt-source regression assertion to keep `webSearch` listed in the deferred-tools block.

### Shared Python Tooling Runtime
- Moved the Agent bash shared Python environment to `~/.molibot/tooling/python/venv`, with pip, uv, and temp directories contained under `~/.molibot/tooling/python`.
- Updated sandbox write allowances and runtime prompt guidance so Python tasks reuse the shared environment instead of creating per-skill `.venv` directories.
- Updated the onlinestool runner script to self-anchor to its skill directory and use the shared Python environment.

### Web Search Query Robustness
- Stopped prepending full current date/time text to every provider query; live lookups now keep concise user keywords unless a date is explicitly useful.
- Added tolerance for weak model tool arguments such as `route: "\n\"auto\"\n"` and `engine: "\n\"auto\"\n"` to prevent repeated webSearch validation failures.
- Changed China-local search fallback to prefer webpage references before provider-generated summaries, reducing the risk of uncited summaries driving final answers.
- Updated prompt wording and regression tests around date-aware search guidance, concise queries, and route ordering.

## 2026-06-02

### Host Bash Compound Command Classification
- Added a conservative Host Bash command classifier that distinguishes reusable capabilities from safe shell glue/helpers and one-time-only scripts.
- Reduced unnecessary one-time approvals for compound commands such as `longbridge ... 2>&1 | head -30` and same-tool chains like `agent-browser ... && sleep 3 && agent-browser ...`.
- Persisted classification metadata into Host Bash approval audit records and surfaced it on `/settings/host-bash` so operators can see the capability, ignored safe helpers/glue, or one-time degradation reason.
- Added focused regression coverage for classifier behavior and approved compound Host Bash execution paths.

## 2026-06-01

### Host Bash Auto-Resume Lock Recovery
- Hardened shared Host Bash approval auto-resume so a transient `Another run is currently active in this session.` conflict no longer crashes Telegram or other shared-text runtimes.
- Added short retry/release polling before the background resume turn is abandoned, plus a user-visible busy fallback message when the session lock does not clear in time.
- Added focused regression coverage for retry-on-lock-conflict and fail-fast behavior on non-lock resume errors.

### Built-In Web Search Tool
- Added a shared Agent-layer `webSearch` tool so current-information lookups no longer depend on loading a reusable skill.
- Added configurable provider settings for DuckDuckGo, Brave, Tavily, Exa, Serper, Baidu Qianfan, and Bocha, with route-based fallback now centered on China-local, global, official-docs, and research search intents.
- Extended the built-in provider list to match the local `web-search` skill scripts by adding `baidu_fast`, `baidu_web`, `ark`, and `grok` to shared settings, routing, and runtime provider execution.
- Added `/settings/search` with shadcn-svelte controls for tool enablement, default routing, engine credentials, timeouts, max results, and live test queries.
- Added automatic engine selection strategies for `engine=auto`: priority order, random, and in-process round-robin across configured engines.
- Added redacted request diagnostics to `/settings/search` test results so operators can inspect the actual provider URL, method, headers, and body used by a search attempt.
- Exposed each provider's effective default base URL in `/settings/search` when the custom base URL field is left empty, using the same shared constants as the runtime providers.
- Added focused tests for search routing, result normalization, and runtime tool risk classification.
- Refined the `webSearch` tool prompt so model answers include a mandatory `Sources:` section, use current-year queries for recent information, and prefer automatic routing unless a specific source or region is needed.
- Upgraded normalized search responses with source-level citations, per-result citation ids, provider metadata, and summary source tracking while preserving the existing `summary` text contract.
- Preserved richer provider fields such as request ids, usage credits, site names, favicons, publication dates, and Baidu/Bocha provider reference ids when available.
- Fixed Baidu Fast search normalization so provider answers are retained even when source references are also returned.
- Updated `/settings/search` Test Query to let operators force a specific engine and inspect the exact `WebSearchResponse` payload returned by `runWebSearch()`.
- Removed Ark from the visible search settings UI while keeping the shared runtime/provider support unchanged underneath.
- Added automatic current date/time context to every runtime web search provider request while preserving the user's original query in `WebSearchResponse.query`, improving relative-time searches such as tomorrow weather, latest prices, and today's news.
- Updated the system prompt Tools Priority Table and tool parameter guidance so current web lookups use the dedicated `webSearch` tool instead of bash curl, browser search, or legacy skill scripts.

### Feishu Local Approval Buttons
- Added `card.action.trigger` handling to the Feishu WebSocket runtime so Host Bash approval buttons work for local-only Molibot instances without exposing `/api/feishu/card` publicly.
- Kept the existing HTTP card callback route for public deployments while reusing the same shared Host Bash approval command path, with a generic Approval Broker fallback for tool approval cards that are not backed by Host Bash records.
- Accepted common Chinese approval replies such as `审批通过` and `通过` as direct approval commands instead of queuing them as normal chat messages.
- Logged Feishu card button delivery with `card_action_received` so callback delivery/configuration issues are easier to distinguish from approval resolver failures.
- Added fallback behavior that edits the original approval card to the result state, or sends a text result when card editing fails.
- Added focused test coverage for Feishu card action payload normalization.

### Local Runtime Persistence
- Added a LaunchAgent plist template for running Molibot under macOS `launchd` with `RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive`, avoiding foreground terminal session shutdowns.

## 2026-06-04

### Scheduled Event Late-Success Retry Suppression
- Stopped `EventsWatcher` from emitting a duplicate retry for the same periodic slot when the first attempt exceeds the nominal timeout but still finishes successfully before the watcher fully unwinds.
- Added a regression test covering the timeout callback plus late-success completion path so long-running scheduled jobs do not produce a second synthetic event after already delivering output.

## 2026-05-31

### Scheduled Event Timeout, Abort, and Retry
- Added a SQLite-backed event execution lease store so scheduled tasks have shared ownership state across watcher, runner, and persisted run records.
- Added configurable event execution controls: 10 minute default timeout, 3 max attempts, and 5 second retry delay.
- Wrapped watched event execution with a timeout watchdog that aborts the current runner/turn before scheduling a retry.
- Added stale running lease recovery on watcher startup so a process restart does not permanently block a scheduled event slot.
- Scoped event leases by channel/bot, reconciled recovered leases back to event JSON state, and made timeout retry wait for the previous runner attempt to release before starting the next attempt.
- Updated `/stop` shared runtime handling to clear active event leases, reducing false `Nothing running.` responses for stuck scheduled runs.
- Passed lease run ids through Telegram, Feishu, QQ, and Weixin event-trigger paths for consistent run/lease correlation.

### Host Bash Full Access When Sandbox Is Off
- Changed the `bash` policy so an effective `/sandbox off` state means Host Bash full access: ordinary bash commands and model-supplied `hostApproval` parameters now run directly on the host without creating a Host Bash approval request.
- Kept the existing sandbox-on approval model: explicit Host Bash requests and sandbox permission failures still produce approval prompts while sandboxing is enabled.
- Added regression coverage for the sandbox on/off policy split, sandbox-disabled host execution, and approved Host Bash paths bypassing sandbox shell execution.
- Updated the session-control guide and README to make the sandbox/approval boundary explicit.

### Separate Reasoning Messages & Latest Progress Mode
- Added `/showreasoning new` across settings, sanitization, commands, and the System settings UI.
- Split reasoning display from final answer rendering for Telegram and Feishu, so visible thinking no longer prefixes or buries the actual answer.
- Updated Telegram streaming so `thinking_delta` refreshes only the reasoning message while `text_delta` refreshes the answer message; `new` mode shows only the latest reasoning sentence and deletes the temporary progress message at completion.
- Updated Feishu streaming so reasoning uses a separate editable text message while the answer remains in the CardKit streaming card; `new` mode closes the temporary reasoning message with a short completion notice.
- Added a Feishu streaming regression test for separate reasoning messages.

### Main Answer Lifecycle & Display Commit
- Added explicit main-answer commit semantics to the runner/channel context boundary. If a model returns multiple terminal assistant messages in one turn, Molibot now shows them as separate user-visible messages instead of letting the last one overwrite the earlier full answer.
- Updated shared text channels, Telegram, and Feishu streaming paths to freeze committed main answers and route later text as supplements instead of replacing the original answer.
- Added a shared context regression test covering committed-answer replacement behavior for non-editable channels.

## 2026-05-30

### Weixin SDK Upstream Upgrade & Context Token Persistence
- **SDK Protocol Sync**: Upgraded vendored `package/weixin-agent-sdk` to match the latest `openclaw-weixin` upstream, selectively migrating messaging-related improvements while keeping the SDK free of OpenClaw plugin dependencies.
- **Context Token Disk Persistence**: Context tokens (required for every outbound Weixin message) are now persisted to `{accountId}.context-tokens.json` on disk and restored automatically on startup, surviving gateway restarts.
- **Account Cleanup Enhancement**: `clearWeixinAccount` now removes associated `.sync.json` and `.context-tokens.json` files alongside the main credentials file.
- **Already-Connected Login Handling**: QR login now gracefully handles the `binded_redirect` status (bot already bound), resolving existing local credentials instead of throwing a login failure.
- **Markdown Filter No-Op**: `filterWeixinMarkdown` is now a transparent pass-through since Weixin natively supports Markdown rendering.
- **Node 24 Compatibility**: Removed manual `Content-Length` header from `buildHeaders` in `apiPostFetch` to avoid conflicts with Node 24 / undici's automatic content-length calculation.
- **Weixin Long-Poll Abort Completion**: Completed the remaining `apiPostFetch` abort merge path so `getUpdates` now honors external `AbortSignal` cancellation immediately during channel stop or hot reload, instead of waiting for the long-poll timeout.

### Browser Automation Timeout Configuration
- **Settings UI**: Added a "Browser Automation" configuration card in Settings → System. Users can now adjust the `agent-browser` (Playwright) default timeout directly via the Web UI without editing `.env` or restarting the service.
- **Display, Reasoning, & Sandbox Settings Configuration**:
  - **Display & Reasoning**: Added a "Display & Reasoning" card in Settings → System to configure model thinking process display (`showReasoning`), tool progress details level (`toolProgress`), and notification limits (`gatewayNotifyInterval`) globally.
  - **Sandbox Security Toggle**: Added a "Tool Sandbox Security" card in Settings → System to easily toggle the OS sandbox for bash command execution (`toolSandbox.enabled`), along with a quick link to the detailed Sandbox Policy page.
- **Environment Variable Injection**: `buildHostEnv` in `hostBashExec.ts` now automatically injects the configured timeout as `AGENT_BROWSER_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`, so all `agent-browser` commands inherit the setting.
- **Default Changed**: Default timeout increased from 25s to 60s to resolve timeouts on slower-loading sites (e.g. feishu.cn). Range clamped to 5s–300s.

### Message Return & Display Layout Optimization
- **Unified DisplayFormatter logic**: Extracted a centralized Markdown message formatter class [displayFormatter.ts](file:///Users/gusi/Github/molipibot/src/lib/server/agent/core/displayFormatter.ts) supporting thinking/reasoning blocks, tool progress, and subagent state outputs.
- **Bot Instance Display Settings & Commands**: Added `display` settings configuration (`toolProgress`, `showReasoning`, `gatewayNotifyInterval`) to the global and channel instance schemas. Developed two new independent commands `/toolprogress` and `/showreasoning` in [channelCommands.ts](file:///Users/gusi/Github/molipibot/src/lib/server/agent/commands/channelCommands.ts) to read and write database-backed configurations scoped to the active Bot/Channel instance. Implemented SQLite table migrations (`display_json` column) and static settings serialization mapping to ensure configurations are fully reboot-resistant. Documented both display settings and sandbox overrides in the new unified user guide [session-control-commands.md](docs/guides/session-control/session-control-commands.md).
  - Refactored Telegram runner and Feishu card streaming session to consume the new `DisplayFormatter`. Integrated progress overrides into QQ and Weixin `processEvent` execution loops: if `toolProgress` is configured as `"off"`, the transient runner progress messages (`_→ tool_` logs) are entirely discarded. Introduced a memory `messagesBuffer` in WeChat and QQ runtimes to batch all progress updates, running state details, run archive notifications, errors, and final response blocks. The buffer is concatenated with double newlines and sent in a single consolidated chat bubble once the execution finishes, or when a file is uploaded or sensitive approval is triggered, avoiding multiple bubble spam.
  - Added sandbox override controls (`/sandbox [session|bot|agent] [on|off|reset]`), `/toolprogress`, and `/showreasoning` commands to the default `/help` command text.
  - Restored Telegram and Feishu auto-resume flow by returning execution orchestration to `baseRuntime.ts`'s unified `executeApprovedHostBash` wrapper. Enhanced session approval regex support for natural Chinese variations (e.g. "允许本轮", "本会话允许", "本轮允许").
  - Fixed a Telegram bug where the final progress message (e.g. `⏳ 正在运行: bash...`) remained permanently visible in `"new"` mode; it is now deleted automatically when the runner completes.
- **Host Bash Approval Scope Resolution Bug Fix**: Fixed a critical bug where approvals for plugins/MCP tools (like `agent-browser`) written by `ToolRuntime` under a UUID `run_id` could not be matched by channel command queries filtering strictly on the chat's `scopeId`. `HostBashStore` now dynamically queries using active `sessionId` fallbacks, resolving execution freezes across Web and IM channels.

### Subagent Depth Propagation & Authentication Boundary Documentation (Review Optimization Tasks 4 & 5)
- **Subagent Approval Depth Propagation**: Added `requestedByDepth` parameters to `createSubagentTool()` and propagated it dynamically by incrementing depth `(options.requestedByDepth ?? 0) + 1` in host approval payloads to ensure correct subagent caller depth visibility.
- **Actor Authentication Boundary Clarified**: Added descriptive inline documentation inside `TurnOrchestrator.prepareTurn()` to define the auth boundaries of turn operations. Clarifies that external actors are authenticated/authorized at the channel runtime level, and TurnOrchestrator only archives their normalized `message.userId` as `actor_id` for session auditing.
- **Test Session Isolation & Mock Alignment**: Resolved runner unit test flakiness caused by hardcoded `"session-1"` collisions on the persistent sqlite settings database by using randomized test session IDs. Fixed mock store signatures in unit tests to include `getSessionSandboxOverride: () => null`.

### Sandbox Multi-Level Control & Approval Auto-Resume
- **Granular Control Chain**: Introduced override resolution hierarchy supporting `Session Override > Bot Instance Override > Agent Override > Global Default`. Allows enabling or disabling sandboxing on specific sessions, bots, and agents dynamically.
- **SQLite Settings Migrations & Storage**: Added `sandboxEnabled` flags to schemas, sanitizers, and settings routes, implementing automatic SQLite database table column updates (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN sandbox_enabled INTEGER`) for channels and agents upon server startup. Full configuration load/save mapping and Switch override UIs have been implemented across Web, Telegram, Feishu, QQ, and Weixin settings pages to avoid silent data loss when saving configurations.
- **Terminal Control Command**: Implemented the `/sandbox` chat command supporting real-time status diagnostics and scope configuration overrides (e.g. `/sandbox session off`, `/sandbox bot on`, etc.).
- **Automatic Resume Flow**: Completed automatic resumption flow for approved commands. Re-writes message history (replacing the temporary approval result placeholder with the real stdout/stderr) and fires a background runner execution (using `isEvent: true` flags) once a sensitive bash command is approved.
- **Dedicated Environment isolation**: Integrated tooling path resolution under `MOLIBOT_TOOLING_DIR` (defaulting to `~/.molibot/tooling`). Built-in shell runner dynamically isolates venv, GOPATH, and GOCACHE within this directory instead of creating temporary virtual environments for every single session.

### Named Sandbox Profiles (Sandbox Profiles)
- **Defined Sandbox Templates**: Introduced three pre-defined sandbox configuration templates (`Observe` read-only mode, `Build` read-write compilation mode, and `Strict` maximum isolation mode) mapping security settings onto environment, network, and filesystem policies.
- **Dynamic Profile Matching & Detection**: Implemented client-side detection to dynamically match active settings with standard profiles. Automatically displays a "Custom Profile" notice if the user alters any individual configuration field in the form.
- **Interactive UI Preset Selector**: Embedded a styled three-card selector group at the top of the `/settings/sandbox` page with smooth hover focus scales, subtle elevation shadows, and active outlines using shadcn-svelte conventions.
- **Chinese & English Localization**: Supported full translation mappings for preset titles, configuration descriptions, custom badges, and status labels in both `zh-CN` and `en-US`.

### Configurable Agent Run Budget Limits
- **Schema & Configuration Store Expansion**: Added `budget: RunBudgetLimits` property to `RuntimeSettings` interface and `schema.ts`. Introduced support for environment variables `MOLIBOT_MAX_TOOL_CALLS`, `MOLIBOT_MAX_TOOL_FAILURES`, and `MOLIBOT_MAX_MODEL_ATTEMPTS`.
- **Sanitization & Clamping Protection**: Implemented custom validation/clamping rules inside settings store and `sanitizeSettings` to automatically restrict user-configured variables to safe ranges (e.g. tool call limits between `1` and `500`).
- **Agent Runner Budget Integration**: Updated `runner.ts` to instantiate `RunBudget` dynamically using the SvelteKit settings store's configured limits instead of the hardcoded `DEFAULT_RUN_BUDGET` constant.
- **Web UI & Localizations**: Created a dedicated "Agent Budget Limits" configuration panel under `/settings/system` settings, allowing administrators to modify limits via the browser with full en-US and zh-CN localizations.

### Agent runner.ts Slimming & Input Enrichment Extraction (v2.2 Phase 5)
- **Top-Level Helper Functions Extraction**: Extracted 16 utility/helper functions from `runner.ts` into a new modular file `runnerHelpers.ts`.
- **Inbound Message Enrichment Extraction**: Extracted audio transcription (STT) routing, vision/image routing fallbacks, and model candidate fallback resolution logic into `runnerInputEnricher.ts`.
- **`runner.ts` Footprint Reduction**: Refactored `MomRunner` to import helper utilities and delegate input preparation to `prepareEnrichedInput`. Completely removed the legacy `blockedOnHostBashApproval` pausing and agent abort logic to transition fully to the new coroutine-blocking model, shrinking `runner.ts` to 1693 lines.
- **`RunnerPool` Isolation**: Decoupled `RunnerPool` from `runner.ts` into `runnerPool.ts` and updated imports in `channelCommands.ts`, `baseRuntime.ts`, and `runtimeContext.ts`.
- **Type Integration & Safety**: Added explicit exported TypeScript interfaces (`AudioRouteDecision`, `VisionRouteDecision`, `ImageFallbackRouteDecision`) to `mediaFallback.ts` to ensure type-safe interfaces across core runner modules.

### Approval Integration & Compatibility Hardening (v2.2 Phase 3D)
- **Tool Coroutine Blocking & Polling**: Implemented a 5-minute timeout polling loop inside `executeToolCall` in `toolRuntime.ts` to suspend the coroutine while waiting for user approval.
- **1.5s Debounce Aggregation**: Added 1.5-second debounce aggregation for `low` and `medium` risk approvals in `toolRuntime.ts` to combine high-frequency operations into a single card prompt.
- **Compatibility Prefix Mapping**: Adjusted host bash tool capability to start with `bash:` (e.g. `bash:${toolId}`), aligning with the old `LIKE 'bash:%'` SQLite filters to restore correct rendering in control commands and setting pages.
- **Parallel Execution Prevention**: Updated `channelCommands.ts` (`approveHostTool` and `approveHostToolForSession`) to verify if the runner is currently active (`status = 'running'`) before executing approved commands, preventing duplicate execution.
- **Abort Signal Integration**: Added `signal` to `ToolExecutionContext` and updated `tools/index.ts` to propagate it, allowing blocked tool coroutines to abort immediately if the runner is canceled.
- **Approval-Pause Decoupling**: Decoupled the old `waiting_for_approval` abort mechanism from `runner.ts`, allowing the runner to stay active (`running = true`) and properly hold the turn lock while suspended in-coroutine. Rewrote `runner.test.ts` to verify event forwarding under this non-aborting flow.

## 2026-05-29

### Legacy ACP Cleanup & Workspace Policy Enforcement (Sprint A)
- **Legacy ACP Physical Deletion**: Moved the legacy ACP (Agent-Channel Proxy) module to `package/acp/` as a relocatable external dependency. Deleted the `src/lib/server/acp/` and `src/routes/settings/acp/` directories, and the `src/lib/server/channels/telegram/acpProgress.ts` file from the main application paths.
- **Config & Settings Decoupling**: Removed all ACP targets, projects, and approval mode schemas, sanitizers, default values, and serialization properties from SettingsStore and the RuntimeSettings interface.
- **Subpath Imports Mapping**: Registered `#acp/*` mapping to `./package/acp/src/*` in `package.json` imports.
- **Feishu Logic Cleanup**: Cleaned up the unused `AcpPendingPermissionView` import and card generators (`buildFeishuAcpPermissionCard`/`buildFeishuAcpPermissionResultCard`) from Feishu messaging.
- **Workspace Security Policies**: Implemented runtime workspace policy checks for tool executions and skill loading. `ToolRuntime.executeToolCall` validates toolId against the workspace's `enabledToolIds` whitelist, and `loadSkillsFromWorkspace` filters skills according to `enabledSkillPaths`.
- **Regression Verification**: Added unit tests in `toolRuntime.test.ts` and `skills.test.ts` to verify whitelist enforcement. All 25/25 agent tests passed successfully.

### Pluggable Sandbox Runtime Module Refactoring
- **Decoupled Sandbox Interface**: Introduced the `SandboxProvider` interface and generic config type shapes (`SandboxNetworkConfig`, `SandboxFilesystemConfig`, `SandboxRuntimeConfig`) inside `sandbox.ts` to decouple sandbox executions from the Anthropic Sandbox SDK.
- **Anthropic Sandbox Wrapper**: Enclosed the default `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` SDK integration inside `AnthropicSandboxProvider`, which implements the new `SandboxProvider` interface.
- **Registry and Dynamic Selection**: Added getter and setter helper registration functions (`getSandboxProvider()` and `setSandboxProvider()`) to support dynamic switching of sandbox runtimes. Refactored preparation and diagnostics helpers in `sandbox.ts` to delegate actions to the active provider.
- **Mock Verification Test**: Added unit test in `sandbox.test.ts` to verify mock provider registration, execution interception, config propagation, and restore isolation. Verified 100% green tests in the agent regression suite.

### ToolRuntime & ApprovalBroker Integration (v2.2 Phase 3)
- **MCP Tool Safety Wrapping**: Modified MCP tool loader in `runner.ts` and `index.ts` to dynamically wrap loaded MCP tools under `ToolRuntime`. Labeled their source as `"mcp"` when their name is prefixed with `mcp__`.
- **Subagent Approval Bubbling**: Propagated parent `runId` from `createMomTools` down to subagents in `subagent.ts` as the `scopeId`. Set `requestedByDepth: 1` during subagent tool approval creation to bubble up permissions.
- **Approval Depth Tracking**: Updated `HostBashStore` SQLite wrapper and `bash.ts` to accept and persist `requestedByDepth` into the `approval_requests` SQLite table, facilitating context tracking of subagent execution vs parent run execution.
- **Verification**: Verified zero compilation errors and full 100% pass rate in both the 25/25 agent test suite and the 5/5 approval/broker test suites.

### TurnOrchestrator Lifecycle Delegation & runner.ts Slimming (v2.2 Phase 2)
- **Lifecycle Delegation**: Delegated turn lifecycle duties—specifically session concurrency locking, memory sync/snapshots preparation, and context compaction—to `TurnOrchestrator`.
- **Session Locking**: Implemented database-backed session locking in `TurnOrchestrator.prepareTurn()` to prevent concurrent active turns in the same session, with a 10-minute auto-release timeout.
- **Memory Snapshot Integration**: Extracted memory sync (`syncExternalMemories`) and snapshot fingerprinting to `TurnOrchestrator.prepareTurnMemory()`.
- **Context Compaction**: Extracted context compaction flow (calculation, model completion, and saving results to session store) to `TurnOrchestrator.compactSessionContext()`.
- **Turn Summary Committing**: Relocated `commitTurn()` to `TurnOrchestrator` to log `RunSummary` and update SQLite run statuses (`completed`, `aborted`, `waiting_for_approval`, `failed`).
- **`runner.ts` Refactoring**: Refactored `MomRunner` to delete these helper functions, reducing its codebase footprint while keeping the client interfaces (`MomRunner.run` and `RunnerPool`) intact.
- **Test Coverage**: Added robust unit tests in `turnOrchestrator.test.ts` verifying concurrent locking, expiration timeouts, memory prep, and status committing. Passed the entire regression suite (25/25 suites green).

### Agent Module Restructuring & Verification (Step 5)
- **Folder Clustering & Modularization**: Relocated and grouped all 60+ cluttered files in `src/lib/server/agent/` into dedicated functional subdirectories: `core/`, `routing/`, `prompts/`, `tools/`, `skills/`, `session/`, `identity/`, `common/`, and `commands/`.
- **Absolute and Relative Path Updates**: Corrected all module imports in JS/TS and Svelte pages workspace-wide to use the structured paths via the SvelteKit `$lib` alias.
- **Node.js ESM Test Loader Hook**: Created `scripts/md-loader.js` and `scripts/register-loader.js` to register a custom Node.js ESM load hook during testing, converting Vite `?raw` markdown templates into valid JS ESM modules on the fly to bypass `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` crashes.
- **Regression Bugs Resolved**:
  - Implemented automatic directory creation (`mkdir(..., { recursive: true })`) in `write.ts` to prevent `ENOENT` crashes when writing scratch artifacts.
  - Adjusted context compaction threshold check from strictly greater than (`>`) to greater than or equal to (`>=`) in `compaction.ts`, resolving compaction tests.
  - Fixed relative URL depth for templates loading in `self-evolution.test.ts` (updated `../../../../` to `../../../../../` due to nested directory depth).
  - Aligned mock error trackers (`modelErrorTracker` and `usageTracker`) in `runner.test.ts` to fix `tracker.record is not a function` mock failures.
- **Verification**: Verified the refactored architecture with `npx node scripts/run-all-agent-tests.js` executing all 25 test suites, obtaining **100% green test results** (25/25 passed).

### Agent Module Refactoring (Step 1, Step 2, and Step 4)
- **Model & Media Helpers Extraction**: Decanted provider/model selection, model routing fallbacks, STT routing, and image description fallbacks from `runner.ts` into new modules `modelRouting.ts` and `mediaFallback.ts`.
- **Double prepareTurn Call Prevention**: Adjusted `turnOrchestrator.ts` to set `input.message.runId` and optimized `runner.ts` to skip redundant DB writes if `runId` is already resolved.
- **ToolRegistry & ToolRuntime Standardized Integration**: Completely refactored built-in tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`) to export `ToolDefinition` schemas. Integrated them into the unified `ToolRegistry` and executed them strictly via `ToolRuntime.executeToolCall`.
- **Sandbox & Host Approvals Centralization**: Replaced mock stubs in `ToolExecutionContext` with functional path-guarded filesystem APIs (`fs.readText`, `fs.writeText`, `fs.readBuffer`) and sandbox-wrapped shell runner (`shell.run`). Centralized sandbox permission failures and approval routing in `decidePolicy`.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Introduced a legacy bridge wrapper `toolDefToAgentTool` to keep `subagent.ts` and legacy callers fully functional with zero regressions.

## 2026-05-28

### Agent v2.2 Runtime Integration
- **TurnOrchestrator 完整整合**: 新增 `src/lib/server/agent/turnOrchestrator.ts`；在 `runner.ts` 包含的所有执行出口路径下调用 `updateRunStatus` 将 run 状态置为非 running；并在 `runtime.ts` 启动时通过 `cleanupStaleRunningTurns` 清理挂起的死锁任务；在 `baseRuntime.ts` 中直接由渠道层预备 turn 状态。
- **ToolRuntime 拦截所有工具**: 所有由 `createMomTools()` 返回的活跃本地工具通过 `wrapWithToolRuntime` 动态接入 `ToolRegistry` 并委托给 `ToolRuntime.executeToolCall()`，以进行鉴权、安全性策略拦截和审批检查。
- **SQLite 审批流融合**: 独立的 `ApprovalBroker` 已完全重写并打通 SQLite 表 `approval_requests` 与 `approval_grants` 的持久化支持。`HostBashStore` 现已映射在该共享表上。
- **Runtime 模块化解耦**: 将包含 650+ 行配置清洗逻辑的 sanitizers 从 `runtime.ts` 提取至 `src/lib/server/settings/sanitize.ts`；将 channel 插件热装载逻辑 `applyChannelPlugins` 提取至 `src/lib/server/plugins/loader.ts`。`runtime.ts` 文件体积大幅缩减至 150 行以内。
- **验证**: 单元测试和聚焦测试完全通过，并在 `turnOrchestrator` 中增加了测试环境下的自动创建表机制。

### Agent v2.2 Refactoring Design Spec (Refined)
- **输出可执行架构规范**: 整合 v2.0 与 v2.1 方案优点，设计并撰写了 `v2.2.md`，确立了由 TurnOrchestrator, PiAgentRuntime, ToolRuntime, ApprovalBroker 和 Workspace 构成的分层重构路线。
- **融入技术评审与安全性收窄**: 吸收 `v2.2-review.md` 建议，明确 Workspace ID 的逻辑属性，决不碰物理目录；将 ACP 下线解耦为第一阶段清引用、最后阶段物理清理；将 TurnOrchestrator 切流灰度化并逐步压缩 runner.ts；在 ToolRuntime/ApprovalBroker 中划分子任务切片、细化 `runs` 状态与索引，提升重构稳定性和安全性。


### Minimum Workspace boundary
- **默认 Workspace registry**: 新增 `workspaces` SQLite 表与默认 `personal` bootstrap，Web/shared channel/runner 路径会解析并携带 `workspaceId`。
- **运行归档可追踪 Workspace**: 新 run summary 和 run detail JSONL 写入 `workspaceId`，为后续 TurnOrchestrator、ToolRuntime 和 Approval scope 收口提供最小边界；本批不迁移既有 session/chat 数据。


## 2026-05-27

### Agent v2.1 simplification planning
- **开发计划落地**: 当时曾将 `v2.1.md` 转成可执行 TODO 清单；该过程计划现已从主 docs 树清理，长期架构结论保留在 Agent redesign 设计文档中。

### ACP active runtime path removal
- **ACP 主路径下线**: Channel runtime 不再实例化 ACP service，Telegram/Feishu/QQ/Weixin 移除 ACP 自动代理和权限回调，`/acp` / `/approve` / `/deny` 改为返回 inactive-path 提示；Settings 与 README 不再把 ACP 展示为活跃能力。

### Agent session persistence hardening
- **失败轮次上下文隔离修正**: 自动 compaction 现在先完成摘要再追加本轮用户消息；无内容的 assistant error 仍保留在 session 审计历史，但不会作为空 assistant turn 回灌到后续模型上下文。
- **Sandbox 写权限收窄**: 移除 Longbridge 日志目录的全局 sandbox 写入放行，避免所有 sandbox 命令都继承额外宿主目录写权限。

## 2026-05-26

### Agent session persistence parity
- **失败轮次持久化对齐 Pi/Pae**: Agent session 现在按消息边界保存用户消息、assistant 失败/partial 输出和工具结果，避免工具预算超限或模型中途报错后继续对话时丢失本轮上下文。

### Host Bash display accuracy
- **工具进度标签修正**: 已批准 Host Bash 直达执行和 session-approved host bash fallback 现在显示为 `Host Bash`，避免 sandbox 开启时在 Web/Telegram/run detail 中误提示为 `Sandbox`。

## 2026-05-25

### Subagent sandbox research
- **竞品与产品边界文档**: 新增 `docs/research/sandbox/subagent-sandbox.md`，对 Claude Code、Codex、GitHub Copilot cloud agent、Replit Agent、Devin、OpenHands、Cursor 的 subagent/sandbox/审批/恢复设计做对比，并转化为 Molibot 下一阶段的用户、边界、数据结构、页面交互和验收标准。

### Host approval environment hotfix
- **审批后环境变量恢复**: approved Host Bash / legacy host tool 执行恢复继承宿主 `process.env`，避免 API key、PATH、HOME 等变量在审批后丢失。
- **安全收窄改为后续设计**: `envAllowlist` 字段继续保留兼容，但本次不再默认用它清空宿主环境；更细粒度的敏感 env 审批另行设计。
- **Subagent 等待审批不再误收尾**: 子 Agent 触发 Host Bash 审批时，`waiting_for_approval` 会贯穿 subagent 汇总和 chain 执行；Web chat / streaming API 不再把临时等待提示写成普通助手历史。
- **审批自动执行恢复**: Host Bash 新审批记录现在保留正确 pending action 类型，批准后按原始 scratch 工作目录自动执行，避免批准成功但命令未继续运行。
- **等待审批不再误报停止**: Host Bash 权限请求触发的内部中断不再覆盖 `waiting_for_approval`，Telegram 不会在审批卡后追加 `Stopped.`。
- **空输出审批执行减噪**: 审批后自动执行成功但没有命令输出时，不再额外发送 `(no output)`，保留成功执行确认并继续展示真实失败输出。
- **Telegram 审批按钮即时响应**: Host Bash 审批按钮会先回复 callback 并更新卡片为执行中，再运行审批后的命令，避免长命令导致 Telegram 报 callback query 过期且用户误以为按钮无效。

## 2026-05-24

### Host Bash approval and context hygiene
- **审批执行跨渠道一致**: QQ / Weixin 现在继承共享 Host Bash pending action 执行路径，Web Chat 也可用 `/hosttools approve|approve-session|reject` 完成审批闭环。
- **Session-only 审批可立即执行**: `approve-session` 不创建长期白名单时，也能基于审批记录自身权限执行当前 pending action，避免批准后自动执行失败。
- **Host Bash 审批链路补齐**: approved Host Bash 执行路径支持 pending action 闭环，环境变量行为在 2026-05-25 热修复中恢复为继承宿主进程环境。
- **运行上下文减噪**: 等待审批时不会把审批卡和长 sandbox 错误写回模型上下文；subagent 超长输出会压缩后再返回父 Agent。

### Subagent artifact routing
- **Subagent 产物路径统一**: 子 Agent 现在继承主 Agent 的日期产物目录，`bash/write` 默认把普通生成文件放入 `scratch/YYYY/MM/DD/`，避免日报文件落在 scratch 根目录导致父 Agent 读取错路径。
- **根目录产物覆盖修复**: `bash` 现在会识别新建或修改过的根目录 HTML/PNG/JSON 等产物，并移动到日期产物目录，避免重复文件名时仍读取旧版本。
- **Subagent 权限审批继承**: 子 Agent 的 `bash` 现在使用主 Agent 的 Host Bash 审批上下文，同一 chat/session 下已批准或本 session 放行的权限会直接生效；子 Agent 新触发审批时也会复用现有 channel 审批卡片。

## 2026-05-20

### Telegram group mention trigger
- **启动时先拿 bot username**: Telegram 运行时现在先通过 `getMe()` 初始化 bot username，再开始 polling，避免运行期间 username 为空导致直接 `@bot` 被误判为未提及。
- **直接 @ 可触发**: Telegram 群聊和超群现在会同时识别 message entities 与纯文本 `@username`，避免直接 `@bot` 的消息已经入站却被当成未提及 bot 丢弃。
- **回复路径保持不变**: 回复 bot 消息仍然继续放行，只是 direct mention 的入口补齐到同等可靠。

## 2026-05-19

### Approved host tool shell parity
- **已批准命令回到 shell 语义**: reusable approved host tool 命中后现在执行原始命令字符串，不再把命令拆成 `command + argv` 直接 `spawn`。
- **环境变量展开一致**: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $WEREAD_API_KEY"` 这类命令会按普通 shell 规则展开环境变量，避免把 `$WEREAD_API_KEY` 字面量发给远端服务。
- **sandbox 分支保持清晰**: 未命中 approved host tool 时仍按设置走 sandbox；未开启 sandbox 时继续走普通 bash/shell。

### Sandbox env precedence and missing-key audit
- **env 文件优先，系统变量兜底**: sandbox allowlist 变量现在同时从宿主进程环境变量和 `.env.sandbox.local` 解析，同名 key 仍以 `.env.sandbox.local` 为准。
- **启动期缺失告警**: runtime 启动时会检查 sandbox allowlist 中声明但两处都未提供的变量，并把缺失 key 名打印到日志，方便尽早发现配置漏项。
- **诊断面补齐**: `/settings/sandbox` 与诊断 API 现在会额外返回缺失的 allowlist key，只显示变量名，不暴露值。

### WeRead skill env/error discipline
- **先验环境再下结论**: 全局 WeRead skill 现在必须先执行 `printenv WEREAD_API_KEY`，只有检查为空时才允许提示用户重新 `export WEREAD_API_KEY=...`。
- **失败必须回显真实调用**: WeRead 请求失败时，skill 现在必须带上实际 `api_name` 和最终请求体上下文，不再只给笼统的“环境变量缺失”判断。
- **服务端业务错不再误判成本地缺 env**: 对 `用户不存在`、鉴权失败、`errcode != 0` 这类 WeRead 服务端返回，skill 现在默认视为真实业务/鉴权错误，而不是自动归因到 sandbox 注入失败。

### Host approval waiting-state semantics
- **等待不再伪装成停止**: sandbox host approval 挂起当前轮次时，runner 现在返回专门的 `waiting_for_approval` 状态，不再复用通用 `aborted`。
- **Telegram 不再误报已停止**: Telegram 运行时不再把这条路径当成手动停止处理，因此不会在审批尚未发生时额外发送误导性的 `Stopped.` 收尾消息。
- **等待提示不写回会话**: Telegram 不再把“Waiting for your decision”这类临时等待提示持久化成正常 assistant 会话内容，避免审批后续跑时带着伪最终答案污染上下文。

## 2026-05-23

### Added
- Added a session-scoped host approval option (`This Session` / `/hosttools approve-session`) that approves the current blocked command without registering a reusable global host tool.
- Added automatic plain-bash fallback for later sandbox permission denials within that same active session only.
- Added a dedicated `/settings/host-bash` management page and `/api/settings/host-bash` backend for reviewing pending approvals, durable whitelist entries, and Host Bash approval history.

### Changed
- Host approval prompts and channel-native approval UIs now expose three choices: approve permanently, approve for this session, or reject.
- Session-only sandbox bypass state now persists in session preferences and expires naturally when the operator creates a new session or switches bot scope.
- Host Bash approval persistence now lives in SQLite tables (`host_bash_approval_records`, `host_bash_whitelist`) instead of being appended into settings JSON payloads; legacy `hostTools` settings are migrated once at runtime startup.
- Fixed the new `/settings/host-bash` management page so whitelist and history action buttons now fire correctly from the shared Button component.

## 2026-05-16

### Layered skills command output
- **默认先看索引**: `/skills` 现在只返回已加载技能的名字和路径，不再默认把 description、aliases 等完整元数据全部刷出来。
- **摘要改成表格**: `/skills` 的默认索引视图现在使用和 `/models` 一样的 Markdown 表格输出，按 `编号 / 名称 / 路径` 展示，扫读更稳定。
- **按需下钻详情**: 新增 `/skills <id>` 单项详情查看，按技能名或 alias 命中后返回 scope、description、aliases、MCP servers、file/base dir 等完整信息。
- **保留完整清单入口**: 新增 `/skills-detail`，用于查看所有已加载技能的完整详情列表；共享聊天命令和 Web chat 的本地命令处理已经统一到同一套输出规则。

### Archived run details and success-path chat cleanup
- **成功后不再挂着大段运行详情**: 成功执行后，Telegram 会把原 `运行详情` 消息收尾替换成一条简短归档提示；QQ / Weixin / Feishu 会补发同样的归档提示，而不是把成功路径的长执行记录一直留在聊天流里。
- **完整记录转为按 run 归档**: runner 现在会把结构化执行明细按 run 写入每个 chat 工作区的 `run-details/*.jsonl`，保留工具开始/结束、重要说明和最终状态，便于之后追查“前几次失败、最后一次成功”的整条执行轨迹。
- **按需查看入口**: 共享命令层新增 `/runlog latest` 与 `/runlog <runId>`，会优先把归档执行记录作为 `.txt` 文件返回到支持文件发送的聊天渠道，避免再次把超长日志刷进会话；Web 现有诊断视图保持不变。
- **Telegram 结果默认引用原消息**: Telegram 最终答案首发和必要时单独发送的成功归档提示，现在都会默认引用用户原始提问消息，便于在聊天流里快速看出“这条结果是回复哪一句”的对应关系。

### Weixin / QQ host approval text fallback
- **无按钮渠道改明示指令**: 微信和 QQ 在收到 host tool approval 时，不再提示用户去点不存在的按钮；现在会发送共享的纯文本降级说明，明确告诉操作者可以直接回复 `批准` / `安装` / `approve` 或 `拒绝` / `reject`。
- **多待审批也可拒绝**: 共享命令层补上 `/hosttools reject <approvalId>`，让无按钮渠道在存在多条 pending approval 时也能像 approve 一样按 id 精确拒绝。
- **共享层收口**: 非交互渠道的 host approval 提示文案现在由共享 formatter 统一生成，QQ/Weixin 只负责消费运行时事件，不再各自复写一套审批说明。

### Single vs one-time host approval
- **两层审批模型**: host approval 现在明确区分“单命令持久授权”和“多命令一次性授权”。像 `mv` / `pip` / `mkdir` 这类单 executable 命令，审批一次后会继续进入 `approvedTools` 复用；带换行、`&&`、管道或其他复合 shell 语法的安装脚本，则只会生成一条精确的一次性 host action 审批。
- **不再伪装成单命令**: 多步骤 shell 流程不再被错误塞进 `mkdir` 之类的持久 host tool 记录里执行，避免“批准的是 mkdir，实际执行的是整段安装脚本”这种语义错位。
- **待审批列表收紧**: 已批准/已拒绝请求现在会从 `pendingApprovals` 挪到独立 history；`pendingApprovals` 只保留真正还在等待操作员处理的请求。

## 2026-05-15

### DESIGN.md 页面改动治理
- **AGENTS 规则补充**: 新增长期协作规则，凡是页面、界面、交互样式等前端展示改动，都必须先遵循 `DESIGN.md`，但不把具体设计细节重复搬进 `AGENTS.md`。
- **文档分工对齐**: `README.md` 与 `prd.md` 现在都把 `DESIGN.md` 标记为页面设计事实来源，避免后续 UI 改动时只看协作规则、不看设计规范。
- **流程约束落地**: `README.md` 的 Documentation Workflow 新增一步，要求页面/UI 改动先校对 `DESIGN.md` 再动代码或样式。

### shadcn-first 页面组件原则
- **组件优先级明确**: 新增长期规则，页面/UI 改动默认优先使用 `shadcn-svelte` 和 `src/lib/components/ui`，除非现有组件体系确实无法实现需求，否则不要回退到非 shadcn 组件。
- **流程同步**: `README.md` 的文档流程与 `prd.md` 的文档结构说明已同步这条原则，后续前端改动会按同一口径执行。

### Settings 首屏框架统一
- **共享壳层收口**: `src/routes/settings/+layout.svelte` 现在统一了暖色设置工作台外壳、左侧导航层级、顶部工具条和移动端导航折叠样式。
- **首屏层级统一**: `src/styles/workbench.css` 新增一套针对 settings 的共享画布、hero、卡片和按钮规则，让各设置页进入后的第一屏先具备一致的宽度节奏、视觉层级和主操作气质，而不需要先重写各页业务逻辑。
- **范围控制**: 这次主要统一框架与首屏，不重写各页面深层表单和保存流；后续如果继续打磨，会按页面逐个清理内部结构。

### Settings 视觉收敛回调
- **页头收紧**: 普通 settings 页面 header 不再被强行包装成大面积 hero，大标题区改回更紧凑的进入节奏，避免首屏空耗高度。
- **卡片边框降噪**: 共享 settings card 边框整体降对比，尤其暗色模式不再出现发白、发硬的简陋描边。
- **Providers 页面补齐**: `/settings/ai/providers` 旧的自定义 `div + header + action` 首屏结构也已改成紧凑 header，避免它继续保留一块明显更大的页头。
- **Card 基础组件去硬描边**: 共享 `Card` 组件默认不再使用 `ring-foreground/10 ring-1`，改成更柔和的边框和轻阴影，避免卡片出现生硬的黑边或亮边。
- **Tasks 页面防溢出**: `/settings/tasks` 现在会对长路径、长 id、错误文本和状态说明自动换行，并把表格列宽和操作按钮收进固定节奏里，不再被长文本顶出页面。

## 2026-05-13

### Concise sandbox labels and Weixin tool batches
- **展示文案收短**: 所有用户可见的 sandboxed bash 工具展示统一改为 `Sandbox`，初始化失败软降级时显示 `Sandbox disabled`，不再使用冗长的 `bash (sandbox)` / `bash (sandbox disabled)`。
- **微信批量工具进度可读性**: Weixin channel 现在会先聚合原始工具进度，再一次性格式化成多行列表发送，避免 5 次工具调用挤成一行。
- **回归覆盖**: 新增 Weixin runtime tests 覆盖多行工具进度格式化与批量发送行为，并同步更新 sandbox 展示名测试。

### Bash-routed host approval
- **入口收敛**: 移除单独的 `hostToolApproval` agent 工具，把 host capability 审批申请收回到 `bash` 入口。
- **审批保持不变**: `bash.hostApproval` 继续写入同一套 pending/approved host tool registry，聊天里的 `安装` / `批准` / `approve` 确认流程保持不变。
- **执行面内收**: `hostToolRun` 也已移除；审批通过后由运行时直接执行保存下来的受控 host action，不暴露第二个 agent 工具，也不会退化成 host shell。
- **结构化审批**: host approval 现在会产出结构化审批 payload，包含标题、正文、选项和请求元数据，供 API/Web/Telegram/Feishu 渲染原生按钮或卡片。
- **自动续跑**: 审批通过后会立刻执行挂起的 host action，不再停在“已批准、等待继续”这一步。
- **白名单直达**: `bash` 现在会先检查已批准 host capability 白名单；命中后直接执行内部 host action，不再先走 sandbox 再失败一次。
- **失败自动提审**: 对可解析成单个 executable + argv 的命令，sandbox 权限失败会直接创建结构化审批请求，而不是等模型再显式补发一次 `bash.hostApproval`。

### Interactive manager TTY disconnect guard
- **交互兜底**: `molibot manage` 现在会把 `readline` 上来自 TTY 断开的 `EIO` 读错误当成正常关闭处理，不再抛出未处理的 `Interface` error。
- **等待态收尾**: 菜单选择和“Press Enter to continue”这类挂起中的 prompt 会在接口关闭时自行结束，避免卡死在未完成的 `rl.question()`。
- **运维体验**: 关闭终端、断开附着会话，或其他导致 stdin 消失的场景下，管理器会安静退出而不是打印 Node 崩溃堆栈。

---

## 2026-05-14

### Host approval rejection acknowledgement
- **拒绝可见回执**: Telegram 和 Feishu 的 host approval 拒绝动作现在会额外发送一条普通文本回复，明确告知该审批已被拒绝，不再只依赖卡片/原消息状态变化。
- **审批阻塞当前轮次**: sandbox 权限失败自动触发 host approval 时，runner 现在会立刻中止本轮并停在“等待审批”状态，不再把“已发起审批”当成成功工具结果继续生成后续答案。

### Cross-channel subagent execution notices
- **统一事件层**: 共享 `subagent` 工具现在会发出 `subagent_execution` 运行事件，覆盖 run start/end 与 task start/end，不再只写 pretty log。
- **共享展示链路**: parent runner 会把这些事件转成与工具调用同级的 transient progress 提示，保持 delegation 能力在共享上层实现，而不是在各 Channel 里各写一套 subagent 逻辑。
- **各端可见性**: Telegram 直播进度块原生显示 Sub Agent 生命周期；Web SSE 把这些事件流式送到聊天诊断面板；Feishu/Weixin/QQ 通过共享文本运行时自动收到“Sub Agent started / task started / task finished / finished”提示。
- **失败隔离与收口**: subagent UI 事件现在走 runner 的 best-effort UI 队列，前端/通道 sink 抛错不再中断实际 delegation；同时 delegated run 失败时会补发终态 `end` 事件，避免跨端进度面板停在 started 状态。

---

## 2026-05-12

### Chat-first host tool approval
- **bash 入口路由**: host tool 审批申请现在由 `bash` 入口承接；模型在 sandbox 权限失败后通过 `bash.hostApproval` 创建 pending approval，不再暴露单独的 `hostToolApproval` agent 工具。
- **聊天确认**: Telegram/Feishu/QQ/Weixin 的共享命令层会拦截同一会话里的 `安装` / `批准` / `approve`，把对应 pending request 写入 approved host tool registry。
- **受控执行**: 审批后只能执行登记时固定的 command，并通过结构化 argv 传参；不使用 shell。
- **沙箱边界**: `bash` 不会自动升级成 host；已批准项是受控 host capability，不是通用 host shell。
- **提示词约束**: 系统提示词要求模型遇到 host-only 工具时通过 `bash.hostApproval` 申请审批，而不是继续用 sandbox bash 绕行。

---

### Manual `/compact` force behavior
- **Keep-window false negative fixed**: Manual `/compact` can now summarize older context even when `keepRecentTokens` is configured larger than the current session context.
- **Auto behavior preserved**: Threshold/overflow compaction still respects the configured keep-recent window; only explicit manual compaction gets force semantics.
- **Root cause clarified**: The previous runner/store sync fix worked for stale runner memory, but this case was caused by the keep-recent setting making the summarizable slice empty.

---

## 2026-05-11

### Manual `/compact` session-state sync
- **Idle runner reload**: Manual `/compact` now reloads the latest persisted session into the idle runner before summarizing.
- **False negative removed**: Fixes cases where `/status` reported a large live context but `/compact` incorrectly returned `Nothing to compact yet.` because runner memory was older than the session log.

### Telegram live-control 命令修复
- **命令入口补齐**: Telegram 现在会把 `/steer`、`/followup`、`/follow_up` 和 `/queue` 先交给共享命令处理器，而不是在忙碌时当成普通消息入队。
- **队列注入恢复**: `/steer <queueId>` 会按已有队列 ID 注入当前任务，不再出现 `/steer 352` 被重新排成 `#353` 的问题。
- **回归覆盖**: 新增 Telegram 命令注册测试，并继续覆盖共享 `/steer <queueId>` 提升逻辑。

---

## 2026-05-10

### Agent Bash OS Sandbox
- **默认关闭**: 新增 `toolSandbox` runtime settings，第一版只覆盖主 Agent `bash` 和内置 subagent `bash`，初始化失败默认软降级并告警。
- **环境变量 allowlist 注入**: Molibot 宿主解析 workspace `.env.sandbox.local`，只把 allowlisted key 注入 sandbox 子进程；诊断与 UI 只显示 key，不暴露 value。
- **边界清晰**: Browser、Computer Use、ACP、MCP、Channel 收发消息不进入该 sandbox；sandbox 开启时会阻断 `open`、`osascript`、直接启动浏览器等明显绕行命令。
- **设置与诊断**: 新增 `/settings/sandbox` 和只读诊断 API，可检查平台、依赖、env 文件、可注入 key、初始化状态、网络和文件系统策略。
- **输出标记**: sandbox 路径生效时，Web/Telegram/tool thread 展示为 `bash (sandbox)`；初始化失败软降级时展示为 `bash (sandbox disabled)`。
- **回归覆盖**: 新增 settings sanitization、env 注入、env 文件 denyRead/denyWrite、host app bypass、sandbox 关闭旧行为保持等 focused tests。

### Scratch 生成物日期归档
- **默认日期目录**: 每轮模型输入新增 transient `scratch_artifact_dir`，普通会话生成物默认进入 `scratch/YYYY/MM/DD/`，不再继续堆在 chat scratch 根目录。
- **工具层兜底**: `write` 工具会把普通文件名自动路由到当天目录；`bash` 暴露 `$MOLIBOT_SCRATCH_ARTIFACT_DIR`，并在命令结束后把新生成在 scratch 根目录的普通产物搬进当天目录。
- **运行时目录不动**: `scratch` 仍是工具 cwd，`scratch/events` 等 watched event/control 路径保持原语义，显式路径不会被日期规则改写。
- **附件兼容**: 如果模型随后仍按旧根路径 attach，`attach` 会查找当天目录里的同名文件，避免 bash 自动归档后发送失败。
- **回归覆盖**: 新增测试覆盖 transient env 字段、`write` basename 路由、显式 `events/...` 路径保持不变、bash artifact env 变量、bash 根目录产物归档，以及 attach 兼容查找。

---

## 2026-05-06

### Skill Draft metadata 规范化
- **skill-creator 规则落地**: 自动 Skill Draft 生成现在会在配置的 workflow `SKILL.md` 使用 skill-creator 规则时，按“功能标识符 + 触发描述”生成 frontmatter metadata，不再把用户原话直接写成 `name`。
- **专用子代理生成**: 新增内置 `skill-drafter` subagent；自动保存草稿前会优先用隔离子代理生成 metadata，失败时回退到本地规范化逻辑。
- **重试类消息兜底**: “重试一下 / 再试一次”这类泛化消息不会成为草稿名；系统会优先从最终结果和工具路径推断可复用功能名。
- **回归覆盖**: 新增自演化测试覆盖昨日数据回顾命名和重试消息命名，保证草稿 `name` 保持可用。

### Settings shadcn-svelte 迁移基线
- **组件体系切换起点**: 新增 shadcn-svelte `components.json`，并生成 Settings 后续会复用的 Button、Card、Alert、Badge、Input、NativeSelect、Separator、Table、Tabs 等源码组件。
- **系统配置页样板**: `/settings/system` 已从旧本地 UI wrapper 和 workbench 页面样式迁移到 shadcn 风格的语义组件组合，作为后续 Settings 页面迁移模板。
- **Web Profiles 表单样板**: `/settings/web` 已迁移为 shadcn 风格的 profile 列表 + 配置表单，覆盖 Switch、NativeSelect、Textarea、Skeleton loading 和 Alert feedback 等更常见的管理页控件。
- **Providers/Tasks 补齐**: `/settings/ai/providers` 的 provider/model 表单、状态反馈和模型发现控件已切到 shadcn-svelte 组件；`/settings/tasks` 行选择框改用共享 Checkbox；旧 providers-page 全局样式钩子已移除。
- **Skill Drafts 扫读优化**: `/settings/skill-drafts` 的长草稿内容默认只显示前 10 行，完整内容通过弹窗表单编辑并保存。
- **聊天页不变**: 本轮只迁移 Settings 基础组件、系统配置页和 Web Profiles 页，主聊天页未改动。

---

## 2026-05-04

### Telegram typing 超时非阻塞化
- **非关键动作降级**: `setTyping` 中 `sendChatAction(typing)` 在超时重试耗尽后改为仅记录 `ctx_set_typing_failed_non_blocking` 告警日志，不再抛错中断整轮运行。
- **运行连续性修复**: typing 指示与最终消息发送解耦；即使 typing API 失败，本轮最终正文或错误提示仍可继续发送给用户。

### Weixin 工具进度发送修复
- **纯文本进度**: Weixin 工具进度批次不再发送 `_→ ..._` Markdown 样式，改为微信更稳的 `工具调用：...` 纯文本格式。
- **停止坏消息重试**: 已经进入 outbox 的旧工具进度批次会在重试时自动改写；如果微信仍返回 `code=-2`，这类非关键进度消息会被丢弃，不再无限重试。

### AI Providers 模型拉取体验
- **批量拉取入口**: `/settings/ai/providers` 的 Custom Provider 新增“开始”按钮，可直接请求远端 provider 的 `/models` 列表。
- **逐条确认加入**: 拉取结果列表在每个模型右侧提供 `+` 按钮，点击后将该模型加入当前 provider 的 Attached Models，避免手动逐条输入模型 ID。
- **新接口**: 新增 `/api/settings/provider-models`，按 provider 协议（OpenAI-compatible / Anthropic）自动拼装模型列表请求并返回去重排序后的模型 ID。
- **保存去重兜底**: 修复 `/api/settings` 在同一 provider 出现重复模型 ID 时触发 SQLite 唯一键冲突的问题；保存时会忽略空模型 ID 和重复 model_id，避免 500。

---

## 2026-05-02

### Weixin 图片消息修复
- **原生图片发送**: Weixin 本地图片附件现在复用 `package/weixin-agent-sdk` 的媒体上传与 `IMAGE` 消息协议，避免维护两套图片 payload 实现。
- **图片链接转发**: 当 Weixin 回复内容是单个图片 URL 或 Markdown 图片引用时，channel 会下载图片并转发为原生图片消息，不再只把链接作为文本发给用户。
- **Weixin 进度压缩**: Weixin channel 现在首条工具进度单独发送，后续工具进度每 5 条合并发送；成功运行不发送中间错误，整轮没有正常答案时才发送最后一条错误说明。
- **QQ 进度压缩**: QQ channel 现在使用同样的 channel-local 压缩策略，首条工具进度单独发送，后续工具进度每 5 条合并发送；中间错误仍只保留最后一条兜底发送。
- **回归覆盖**: 新增 Weixin outbound 测试，覆盖本地图片文件发送和 Markdown 图片链接转图片消息。

---

## 2026-05-01

### Subagent 路由与可见性
- **Subagent 模型级别路由**: `/settings/ai/routing` 新增 subagent fallback route，并支持把 `haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus` / `thinking` 四个抽象级别映射到任意已配置文本模型；内置 scout/planner/worker/reviewer 不再展示未配置的具体 Claude 型号作为默认模型。
- **设置持久化修复**: 修复 runtime settings 更新路径丢弃 subagent 路由字段的问题，保存后的 DeepSeek/Sub2API 等 subagent 路由现在会真实参与后续运行与页面展示。
- **Agents 页面只读清单**: `/settings/agents` 新增单独的 Subagents 侧边入口，右侧展示 role、描述、工具、模型级别和当前真实生效模型来源，不提供编辑入口。
- **提前委派策略**: 代码库任务现在会被明确要求在预计 8 次以上直接工具调用时提前使用 subagent；父 run 连续使用 12 次工具且还没用过 subagent 时，runtime 会插入一次临时委派提示，避免等到 24 次硬上限才进入无工具续写。
- **运行可见性**: Web trace 现在记录工具 start/end，Telegram 工具进度可识别 subagent 调用，并将工具结果摘要限制到 20 个字符。

### Weixin SDK 协议同步
- **生命周期通知**: `package/weixin-agent-sdk` 新增 `notifyStart` / `notifyStop`，高层 SDK 启停流程会尽力通知 Weixin 后端。
- **BotAgent 元数据**: 所有 SDK API 请求的 `base_info` 现在带有经过格式清洗的 `bot_agent`，便于后端日志归因；非法值会安全降级为 `OpenClaw`。
- **扫码登录升级**: QR 登录改为 POST 本地 token hint，支持手机配对码、验证码锁定、已绑定提示和 IDC redirect 状态。
- **回归覆盖**: 新增 API 测试覆盖 `bot_agent` 清洗、生命周期通知请求体，以及已有发送失败/长轮询 abort 行为。

### QQ SDK 上游能力同步
- **SDK 对齐 v1.7.1**: `package/qqbot` 升级到上游 QQ Bot SDK v1.7.1 源码形态，补齐群策略、引用消息上下文、Slash 命令、审批交互、输入状态、流式消息、STT 附件处理等模块。
- **媒体发送增强**: QQ 出站媒体现在包含分片上传、上传缓存、受保护的远程下载、图片/语音/视频/文件统一发送队列，以及更稳定的用户可见错误映射。
- **Molibot 边界适配**: 保留 molibot 的共享队列、会话推进和任务编排职责在上层，QQ SDK 只承担平台协议、消息转换和媒体传输；同时移除了对不存在的 `openclaw/plugin-sdk/core` 运行时入口依赖，并把 `/bot-upgrade` 默认保持为文档指引模式。
- **直连模式修复**: Molibot 通过 `onEvent` 接管 QQ 入站时，SDK 不再触发 OpenClaw runtime 预检、审批 gateway、SDK slash 拦截或消息处理时的 `getQQBotRuntime()`，避免 `QQBot runtime not initialized` 引发重连风暴和 QQ `/gateway` 限频。
- **回归覆盖**: 更新 `package/qqbot` 媒体出站测试，覆盖缺失凭证短路和稳定错误文案映射；`package/qqbot` 编译与主工程生产构建均已通过。

### 生产部署与自动更新
- **Release Bundle**: 新增 `npm run release` / `bin/molibot-release.sh`，可构建 `dist/molibot-release`，包含 `build/`、生产依赖、运行所需模板资源和 service 脚本，生产运行不再需要源码目录。
- **GitHub 自动更新**: 新增 `bin/molibot-update.sh`，支持拉取 GitHub 仓库、构建 timestamped release、原子切换 `current`，并用 `MOLIBOT_APP_DIR` 重启托管进程。
- **Service 启动目录控制**: `bin/molibot-service.sh` 支持 `MOLIBOT_APP_DIR` / `MOLIBOT_START_COMMAND`，可以从 release bundle 或其他构建产物目录启动。
- **Docker 运行路径**: 新增多阶段 `Dockerfile`、`.dockerignore` 和 `docker-compose.yml`，支持镜像化生产部署。
- **生产依赖补齐**: 将 Weixin QR 登录运行时会动态导入的 `qrcode-terminal` 提升为根包直接依赖，避免 release/Docker 环境缺失外置依赖。
- **交互式管理器**: 新增 `molibot manage`，用轻量菜单完成 GitHub 部署配置、安装/更新、启动、停止、重启、状态、日志查看和受保护的运行文件卸载。
- **目录覆盖保护**: 自动更新现在要求非空部署目录带有 `.molibot-deploy` 标记，release 打包也拒绝覆盖非 release 目录，避免误把已有开发 workspace 或配置目录清空。
- **Web 版本检查**: Web 右上角现在显示当前版本，并通过只读 `/api/version` 检查 GitHub 是否有新版本；浏览器只提示，不执行自动更新或重启。
- **系统配置页**: 新增 `/settings/system`，集中配置界面语言、运行时时区，并只读展示 GitHub 地址/ref 和版本状态；右上角版本徽标同步放大，避免版本文字不可见。
- **GitHub 默认来源**: 部署更新、管理器和版本检查默认使用 `https://github.com/gusibi/molibot` 的 `master` 分支，未配置时也能显示和检查默认仓库。
- **旧仓库安装兼容**: 自动更新在拉到的源码还没有 release 管理脚本时，会从当前安装器注入必要脚本后再构建；后续如果源码目录里残留旧的未跟踪注入脚本，也会刷新为当前安装器版本，避免首次安装旧提交时报 `./bin/molibot-release.sh` 不存在或继续复用 stale 脚本。
- **生产依赖自愈**: release 构建会在源码构建前补齐根包缺失的运行依赖（当前包括 `qrcode-terminal` 和 `mpg123-decoder`），避免旧源码 checkout 因子包动态依赖未提升到根包而构建失败。
- **Release 资源完整性**: release bundle 现在包含内置 subagent Markdown 定义，避免生产环境 `/api/settings/subagents` 因缺少 `scout.md` 等文件报 500 并影响 Agents 设置页显示。
- **轻量进程守护**: `bin/molibot-service.sh start` 现在启动脚本级 supervisor，Molibot 子进程异常退出后会自动延迟重启；`stop` 会写入停止标记，确保人工停止不会被守护循环重新拉起。

### 图片识别传输格式修复
- **自定义视觉直传加验证门槛**: 自定义 provider 只有在模型 `vision` 能力验证通过后，图片消息才会走原生多模态 streaming transport；未验证但已声明 `vision` 的模型和备用候选不再宣告原生图片输入，改走 direct image-understanding fallback。
- **队列图片恢复修复**: Telegram/QQ/Weixin/Feishu 入队消息仍会清空大体积 base64，但出队处理时现在会用 workspace-relative 附件路径恢复 `imageContents`，避免图片只以文件路径形式进入模型而绕过 fallback。
- **MiMo Anthropic 角色格式修复**: 显式配置为 Anthropic 的 custom provider，其 runner 与图片 fallback 请求会把 `system`/`developer` 内容移到顶层 `system` 字段，不再发送 `messages[].role=system`；fallback 默认打印脱敏后的 `image_analysis_request`，请求头同时兼容 MiMo 的 `api-key`。
- **图片 payload 更可控**: fallback 路径继续使用显式 OpenAI-compatible `image_url` 或 Anthropic-compatible `image/source` 请求体，避免图片消息在未确认兼容的 SDK transport 中失效。
- **安装级图片测试资源**: `molibot init` 现在会把随包携带的 68-byte `vision-smoke.png` 复制到 `<DATA_DIR>/fixtures/vision-smoke.png`，provider vision 测试从用户工作区读取真实图片字节再发请求。
- **回归覆盖**: 新增 custom protocol helper、queued attachment rehydration 与 image fallback 请求体测试，覆盖 Anthropic baseUrl 推导、图片请求头构造、相对附件路径读回 base64，以及 OpenAI-compatible `image_url` / Anthropic `image/source` 两种真实图片 payload。

## 2026-04-29

### 自定义 Provider Anthropic 协议
- **协议选择持久化**: 自定义 AI provider 新增 `openai-compatible` / `anthropic` 协议配置，旧配置自动按 OpenAI-compatible 迁移，SQLite 设置表同步保存协议字段。
- **Anthropic Messages API 支持**: `/settings/ai/providers` 可选择 Anthropic Messages，默认路径切到 `/v1/messages`；连接测试使用 `x-api-key` 与 `anthropic-version` 请求头，并支持文本/视觉能力验证。
- **运行时协议分流**: Web custom-provider 直连、主 runner、自定义 subagent 模型构建、图片理解 fallback 都会按协议选择 OpenAI Chat Completions 或 Anthropic Messages payload/transport。
- **思考参数体验修正**: 协议切换现在会立即更新默认 endpoint 和 thinking format；Reasoning Effort Mapping 默认使用按格式内置的自动映射，只在选择 Custom override 时显示下拉覆盖值。
- **测试错误详情增强**: Provider 测试接口会格式化 JSON 错误并返回更长的上游响应片段，Providers 页面也不再把长状态压成单行省略号。
- **模型行内测试反馈**: 单个模型的 Test Connection 结果现在显示在对应模型卡片内，不再占用保存按钮旁边的页面级状态区。
- **Anthropic 运行时 endpoint 修复**: Runner/subagent 传给 Anthropic transport 的 base URL 现在与 `/v1/messages` endpoint 语义匹配，避免测试成功但实际对话请求到重复 `/v1` 路径而 404；模型错误日志同步展示推导后的 endpoint。
- **图片路由优先级修复**: 当 `visionModelKey` 单独配置了图片模型时，图片消息会优先使用该 vision 路由，而不是被同样声明 `vision` 的 text 路由抢走；如果 vision 请求失败但 fallback 恢复成功，会先发送一条独立失败提醒再继续输出结果。

### 文档治理整理
- **AGENTS 规则提炼**: 从 `prd.md` / `features.md` 中抽出了长期有效的协作与架构规则，补充到 `AGENTS.md`，包括文档职责分层、事件调度落地边界、以及 prompt/profile 规则必须真实生效而不只是出现在 source 列表。
- **README 文档分工说明**: 更新 `README.md` 的文档说明区，明确 `README` / `AGENTS` / `prd` / `features` / `CHANGELOG` 各自职责，并补充统一的文档维护流程。
- **变更记录对齐**: 将这次文档治理调整同步记录到 `features.md`、`prd.md` 和 `CHANGELOG.md`，让规则、计划、已交付事实三者保持分层一致。

### 对话时间感知
- **每轮消息注入当前时间**: Runner 现在会在发送给模型的实时用户消息前注入结构化 `<env>` 块，包含 `message_received_at`、`timezone` 和 `today`，让模型能直接感知当前时间并更稳定地处理“今天/明天/下周”这类时间表达。
- **不污染持久化上下文**: 这段时间元数据只用于实时模型输入，保存到 session context 的仍是原始用户文本加附件标记，避免把临时环境信息塞进长期会话历史。
- **设置页时区入口**: `/settings/ai/routing` 新增 runtime timezone 下拉选择，优先展示常用时区并保留完整 IANA 列表；后端保存前仍会校验时区名，确保调度、用量统计和消息时间上下文使用同一时区基准。
- **系统提示词去时间化**: 运行时 system prompt 里原先的 `Server timezone` / `run: date` 提示已移除。当前时间感知只保留在每轮实时 `<env>` 注入里，避免把时间相关内容继续留在期望缓存的系统提示词层。

### Workbench UI 统一
- **共享 Workbench 样式层**: 新增 `src/styles/workbench.css`，把 hero、panel、toolbar、config shell、table、status line 等视觉规则收敛到共享层，不再让 Settings 页面各自携带一套私有样式。
- **AI 设置页去本地样式化**: `/settings/ai/usage`、`/settings/ai/errors`、`/settings/ai/routing`、`/settings/ai/providers` 已移除页面内 `<style>`，改由共享 workbench 体系统一接管。
- **Settings 全区同一产品语言**: Agents、Web Profiles、Telegram、Feishu、Weixin、QQ、MCP、Tasks、Skills、Skill Drafts、Run History、Memory Rejections、Plugins、ACP、Memory 等页面统一到同一套材质、间距和表单反馈规则。
- **主聊天页材质统一**: Web chat 保留对话优先的安静节奏，但侧边栏、顶部栏、Composer、Files pane、Prompt Preview / New Chat 弹层已切到同一套 workbench 材质体系，和 Settings 看起来像同一个产品。

### 缓存命中率可视化
- **缓存命中比例 KPI**: `/settings/ai/usage` 顶部新增缓存命中比例卡片，直接显示当前筛选范围内的 prompt cache 命中比例。
- **缓存命中趋势折线图**: 同页新增缓存命中比例趋势图，按当前时间窗口（小时或天）展示命中率变化，方便判断缓存是否持续有效。
- **口径明确**: 命中率统一按 `cache read / (input + cache read)` 计算，只看 prompt 侧 token，不把 output 或 cache write 混进去。

### Usage 时间窗自动刷新
- **点击时间范围即重拉数据**: `/settings/ai/usage` 的 `今天 / 昨天 / 最近 7 天 / 最近 30 天` 现在会在切换标签时立即调用后端重新拉取 usage 数据，不再只改本地 tab 状态。
- **无需二次点击刷新**: 切换时间范围后，顶部日期窗、`更新于` 时间和所有 KPI / 趋势图都会跟着同一轮新数据更新，不需要再手动点一次“刷新”。

### Web Chat 文件工作区
- **通用文件上传**: Web chat 输入区不再限制为仅图片上传；现在可以直接附加 PDF、Markdown、代码、JSON、音频、视频和其他常见文档文件。
- **右侧文件面板产品化**: 右侧 Files pane 从占位块升级成真实的当前会话附件工作区，支持搜索、类型筛选、待发送 / 已发送分组，以及会话切换联动刷新。
- **常见格式预览**: 图片、音频、视频、PDF、Markdown、文本/代码、JSON/CSV/YAML 现在可以内嵌预览；Office 和未知二进制格式会降级为元信息 + 下载。
- **安全浏览动作**: 面板提供下载和复制相对存储路径，不引入删除、重命名、移动这类高风险文件管理动作。
